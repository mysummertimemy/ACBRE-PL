@0  =  ~Hey there, <GABBER>! How are you on this lovely day? The sun is shining, the flowers bloom and everything is just right.~
@1  =  ~Hey Adam. I've been looking for you. You know, at Winthrop's there's a pretty angry dwarf who...~
@2  =  ~Sometimes I really envy you for your free time, Adam. How do you manage that?~
@3  =  ~What are you doing outside? Did Reevor actually grant you some free time?~
@4  =  ~You're a real sluggard, huh? Get to work!~
@5  =  ~You're a real sluggard, huh? Get to work before I get you moving!!~
@6  =  ~You're a real sluggard, huh? Get to work before I show you my newest tricks!~
@7  =  ~You're a real sluggard, huh? Get to work! Remember, the gods see everything.~
@8  =  ~You're a real sluggard, huh? How I envy you ...~
@9  =  ~You're a real sluggard, huh? To work, nature can wait!~
@10 =  ~You're a real sluggard, huh?~
@11 =  ~Oh boy, you ruffians are truly a nuisance. But unfortunately duty just has to wait.~
@12 =  ~Oh boy, you paladins are truly a nuisance. But unfortunately duty just has to wait.~
@13 =  ~Oh man, don't brag just because you can hold a spellbook the right way. Unfortunately duty just has to wait.~
@14 =  ~Oh boy, you've just received your ordination and you're already acting more conscientious than Helm himself. Unfortunately, duty will have to wait.~
@15 =  ~Come on, you sneak away time and again yourself to get away from having to work. Sometimes duty just has to wait.~
@16 =  ~And this from a druid? You cannot be serious. Sometimes duty just has to wait.~
@17 =  ~As if you would do more when you go sneaking through the woods. Sometimes duty just has to wait.~
@18 =  ~I am trying to avoid it, what do you think?~
@19 =  ~Reevor? Oh man, don't get me started on him. If *he* would catch me, I'd be in some serious trouble. But sometimes you got to do what you got to do.~
@20 =  ~You know, if you receive the muse's kiss, you have to use it. I'm going to write a poem about the roses. Do you want to read it when it's finished?~
@21 =  ~Of course, Adam! I love poems!~
@22 =  ~No thanks Adam, poetry has never been my thing.~
@23 =  ~Do it, but at Winthrop's there is a pretty angry dwarf, who...~
@24 =  ~Yes, I know. I'll show you when I'm done.~
@25 =  ~Maybe I dedicate it to you, what do you say?~
@26 =  ~Adam! You surprise me!~
@27 =  ~Are you flirting with me, Adam?~
@28 =  ~I'm not really interested in anything like that.~
@29 =  ~Don't be stupid. What am I supposed to do with a poem?~
@30 =  ~You know, at Winthrop's there is a pretty angry dwarf, who...~
@31 =  ~Well you can forget it now. I think I need a little peace and quiet.~
@32 =  ~Before you fall asleep here, at Winthrop's there is a pretty angry dwarf, who...~
@33 =  ~Take care, Adam.~
@34 =  ~How unfortunate, <CHARNAME>. Poems are something wonderful.~
@35 =  ~How would you like me to dedicated it to you when it's finished?~
@36 =  ~Take care, <CHARNAME>.~
@37 =  ~That's what poets do, right? You dedicate your poems to beautiful women.~
@38 =  ~And you think I am one...?~
@39 =  ~Well, I mean ... (Adam clears his throat uncomfortably)~
@40 =  ~I mean, if we have the time... would you go out with me?~
@41 =  ~Now this is... surprising.~
@42 =  ~I'll think about it, alright?~
@43 =  ~I would rather go out with a Gibberling with hip disease, Adam.~
@44 =  ~Too bad.~
@45 =  ~Well, aren't we in a good mood today.~
@46 =  ~Well, I'm a man and you're a woman... it is only natural...~
@47 =  ~That would be really nice of you since I am a man and you a woman...~
@48 =  ~Hello again, <CHARNAME>.~
@49 =  ~Just wanted to quickly check if everything is alright.~
@50 =  ~A dwarf? And what does that have to... oh.~
@51 =  ~Damn it, <CHARNAME>! Now I remember why I have this great tome with me.~
@52 =  ~He's going to tear my head off, huh?~
@53 =  ~Not if you hurry. Go, bring him his book.~
@54 =  ~Don't worry, I'll take care of it. Just give me the book and I'll make sure that he gets it.~
@55 =  ~Yes... yes. You're right. I'm on my way!~
@56 =  ~You would do that? Man, that takes a load off my mind. You're a real friend.~
@57 =  ~You may think lazy Adam can only lie under the tree and write poems, huh? I'll show you! I have the POWER!~

@1 = ~Buzzurk! I don't know what this crazy <PRO_RACE> over there is thinking, but *I* think that you deserve a good spanking. Cheeky brat!~
@2 = ~You of all people are saying that?!~
@3 = ~Oh great. Yet another person who believes she knows it all. You and <CHARNAME> will get along brilliantly.~
@4 = ~Well my intuition tells me there seems to be only ONE person who thinks he knows everything...~
@5 = ~No soothsayer needed to foretell that. Just look at this crazy <PRO_RACE> for a while.~
@6 = ~(Amber glances at Breagar with an ambiguous expression, while he shrugs and goes back to taking care of his weapons.)~
@7 = ~I dream almost every night of what I experienced with <GABBER>. And usually I wake up screaming. Pah!~
@8 = ~You are the one thats getting a lesson today, slaver!~
@9 = ~And what would that be, pray tell?~
@10 = ~That you better respect everyone's freedom if you do not want to shit out your own teeth next morning!~
@11 = ~Keep quiet, lad. It would be a shame if something would happen to anyone here.~
@12 = ~What's this? Are you threatening me?~
@13 = ~Fine. Where's my knife?~
@14 = ~I won't ask a second time! Buzzurk!~
@15 = ~I know for sure that I had it an hour ago and now it's gone! Whose head do I need to bash in to get back my knife?~
@16 = ~(giggles)~
@17 = ~Oh, by Moradin's beard! I should have known!~
@18 = ~You do not seem to be watching your property as sternly as you are concerned about it, friend.~
@19 = ~Because every sane being in this world knows that you never steal from a dwarf!~
@20 = ~Oh come on, I did not steal from you. I have made you aware that you should take better care of your things! (Amber throws the knife back to Breagar with an elegant move.)~
@21 = ~Pah. (Breagar catches the knife with his silver hand and carefully checks the blade)~
@22 = ~What did you do with it? My knife was not that notchy *before* you stole it!~
@23 = ~That's what you think.~
@24 = ~Hrmph.~

@0 = ~Hrmph. We are too far down to find anything moving that won't try to harm us. Nothing but the worst scum dwells in such deep caves.~
@1 = ~Buzzurk! That damned bastard! We must catch him, <CHARNAME>!~
@2 = ~By Clangeddin's Axe, I'll batter his belly with steel!~
@3 = ~The ship sank, it did! With all hands! Swam for our lives we did! And instead of ending up somewhere safe, this foolish <PRO_RACE> lead us to an island full of goddamn werewolves!~
@4 = ~As if *that* wasn't enough, we ended up being infected with damn Lycantrophy!~
@5 = ~Yes, *that* is what happens when you travel by ship! Pah!~
@6 = ~Come on and do what you have to do, so we can leave this place. Foolish <PRO_RACE>.~
@7 = ~Buzzurk. This is ... that is unnatural, <CHARNAME>.~
@8 = ~Do not worry, Breagar. We will look into the matter thoroughly.~
@9 = ~You aren't going to bail out on me, are you?~
@10 = ~You know, sometimes I'm really surprised by your degree of perception.~
@11 = ~I hope so, <PRO_RACE>. I really hope so.~
@12 = ~Bailing out? Me? Pah! I'll show you who'll be needing a rest first, foolish <PRO_RACE>. Move your bony arse! Buzzurk!~
@13 = ~Pah.~
@14 = ~Ribalt's store! By Moradin's hammer, I've always wanted to go here! Maybe this trip to down south isn't so bad after all, <CHARNAME>.~
@15 = ~(Breagar gnashes his teeth, his fingers turn white from clasping the handle of his axe.)~
@16 = ~(Pat Breagar on the back and move on.)~
@17 = ~Are you alright?~
@18 = ~This will be hard, my friend.~
@19 = ~We will prevail.~
@20 = ~(Breagar silently nods to you and moves along.)~
@21 = ~At the thought of putting a stake into this vampire toad where the sun never shines? You can bet your ass I'm alright.~
@22 = ~Breagar stands by your side, <CHARNAME>. Teach this vampire toad a lesson she won't forget.~
@23 = ~Of course we will prevail (snort).~
@24 = ~I am eager to give this toad a good thrashing.~
@25 = ~By Moradin's beard!~
@26 = ~Well, whoever did that seems to be more of an animal, than a human... I don't like that. (Breagar spits out audibly.)~
@27 = ~Clever as always. Stop idling and find a way back!~
@28 = ~And I can feel the joints of my armor starting to freeze! Stop idling and find a way back!~
@29 = ~Finally a few reasonable words! Stop idling and find a way back!~
@30 = ~<CHARNAME>, this may sound strange. But you know, I'm glad to be here with you.~
@31 = ~I'm glad to have you with me.~
@32 = ~You're not sick, right?~
@33 = ~I think you had better stay up in the Asylum, eh?~
@34 = ~As long as you do your work you may stay.~
@35 = ~It's good to hear that.~
@36 = ~No more than any of the others.~
@37 = ~Pah. Try seeing things from my point of view for once, foolish <PRO_RACE>.~
@38 = ~Pah. As if I'd ever disappointed you.~
@39 = ~Traveling with you down this path means I get to step on the feet of all the right people. Sooner or later, that path will lead to success.~
@40 = ~And now let's get out of this mess.~

@47 = ~(Breagar looks at you while pondering the axe in his hand.)~
@48 = ~Breagar? Is everything all right?~

@55 = ~You are a child of Bhaal. Everything makes sense now.~
@56 = ~Why do you think that?~
@57 = ~Are you out of your mind?~
@58 = ~You cannot be serious about that!~
@59 = ~Give it a try!~
@60 = ~(Strike.)~
@61 = ~You were honest and I thank you for it.~
@62 = ~I have to think about it. For now, I'll go on following you.~[acbre_71]
@63 = ~Good gods, <CHARNAME>. It seems a lifetime ago that you fetched books for Candlekeep's visitors, hm?~
@64 = ~And now look at <PRO_HIMHER>, the foolish <PRO_GIRLBOY> has become a real <PRO_MANWOMAN>.~
@65 = ~Life burns you faster than the hottest fire, so they say.~
@66 = ~Here we are now, at the end of our journey.~[acbre_75]
@67 = ~No matter the outcome. I am happy and proud to be here with you.~[acbre_76]
@68 = ~By Clangeddin's axe! That was a fight like the battles of old no less!~ [acbre_77]
@69 = ~Ye have fought bravely, <CHARNAME>, and earned your victory.~
@70 = ~Ye have fought bravely, <CHARNAME>, and earned your victory. Our journey shall end here, my oath is fulfilled. I wish you all the best in life!~
@71 = ~Well, here we are in the big city. Let's hope that some answers finally wait for us here.~
@72 = ~Impressive. On my last visit, I wasn't admitted here. I had really wanted to take a look at the architecture and now I know  why it's reputation precedes it so. ~
@73 = ~Behind this bridge is Baldur's Gate, <CHARNAME>. Do you think you'll get answers regarding your destiny there?~
@74 = ~It sounds like you aren't sure that it will.~
@75 = ~I guess there is only one way to find out.~
@76 = ~All paths lead to this.~
@77 = ~I don't know where else we could go.~
@78 = ~So far, every hint has spun us even deeper into this sticky web. Let's hope that we can keep pushing forward to the roots, so we have something worth a beating. Buzzurk!~
@79 = ~Right you are. Let's go.~
@80 = ~And so far every path has only led us to further conspiracies. Let's hope that we can keep pushing forward to the roots, so we have something worth a beating. Buzzurk!~
@81 = ~Well, that's not the best approach, but at least it makes sense.~
@82 = ~Buzzurk! Then it's true. The bloody bastards have actually put the Orothiar mine back into service. That explains everything.~
@83 = ~What do you mean? What explains it?~
@84 = ~Right you are. Forward!~
@85 = ~Then we'd better make sure that the mine is decommissioned, right?~
@86 = ~Just once, try to use your head a little bit, <CHARNAME>. Even a <PRO_RACE> as foolish as you should get it.~
@87 = ~Right you are!~
@88 = ~If you'd know how right you are with that.~
@89 = ~The great water. *That* one, get it?~
@90 = ~Pah! If I didn't know better I would think you tried to insult me.~
@91 = ~Pah! Do not talk to me as if I was a beardless Dwarthan, foolish <PRO_RACE>!~
@92 = ~I would be really thankful for it.~
@93 = ~If you are use to being surrounded by a stable ceiling and a solid floor, moving as much as we do makes you nervous. When there are no walls, everyone can see us from a long way.~
@94 = ~Hrmph. Let us move on, or I'll start feeling *really* uncomfortable.~
@95 = ~What the ... oh damn! This accursed mage! May the Abyss get him!~
@96 = ~Where the hell are we, <CHARNAME>?~
@97 = ~Somewhere where it's pretty cold, I would say.~
@98 = ~North, perhaps. In any case, there is quite a lot of ice.~
@99 = ~Who cares? Let us make sure that we leave here as soon as possible.~
@100 = ~I - (cough) - knew it! Damn, I knew it!~[acbre_82]
@101 = ~It's all your fault! I would strangle you with my bare hands if I didn't need all my strength to keep standing!~[acbre_83]
@102 = ~Woe betide you if you do not find a decent way away from this godforsaken place, because then I will beat you back through the sea myself!~
@103 = ~In the name of Moradin, Berronar and all the assembled Mordinsamman, I solemnly swear to you that I, Breagar of the clan Bardormar, will never set foot on a ship again. Never again!~ [acbre_85]
@104 = ~Who knows what forces lie dormant in you and what ambitions you harbour ... It is difficult to decide.~
@105 = ~Would you rather be measured by your deeds?~
@106 = ~Or by your inner attitude?~
@107 = ~Tell me, <CHARNAME>. What does it mean for you to be a child of Bhaal?~
@108 = ~It's a shock. I do not want that!~
@109 = ~A revelation! Finally I know that I can kill whatever and whenever I want!~
@110 = ~I'm not sure. I wish I could ignore everything.~
@111 = ~I need to learn more and realize what my responsibility is.~
@112 = ~If this is my destined path, then I'll take it. No matter where it leads.~
@113 = ~Buzzurk. Something has desecrated this place, <CHARNAME>.~
@114 = ~Something... or someone.~
@115 = ~The rest of the dead is sacred, perhaps even more sacred to my people. And disturbing it is the deepest disgrace.~
@116 = ~Whatever caused this must be destroyed.~
@117 = ~Now I realize what's been bothering me about this damn city all this time, <CHARNAME>.~
@118 = ~Why must people always build their cities so close to the sea. Brrr.~
@119 = ~The sea is a place full of wonder, Breagar. You should try ...~
@120 = ~Buzzurk! Speak not another word, silly fool!~
@121 = ~No sane dwarf would voluntarily enter such a nut shell, I tell you! A place full of wonder, pah! Such a thing can only come to a human's mind!~
@122 = ~Just once I've let myself be persuaded by <CHARNAME> and followed <PRO_HIMHER> onto a friggin' boat. And what happened?~
@123 = ~Breagar...~
@124 = ~You should...~
@125 = ~I have not...~
@126 = ~But...~
@127 = ~Now it's...~
@128 = ~Buzzurk. I do not like that, <CHARNAME>. People who build such cellars have evil in mind.~
@129 = ~Don't the dwarfs dig even deeper?~
@130 = ~You are not really comparing a dwarf hall with this... this...  hole here, aren't you?! Good grief, I should have expected that a foolish tree-hugger wouldn't know better, I should pull you through the next clan hall by your ears!~
@131 = ~Alright, alright. May the gods save us from that! I still need my ears!~
@132 = ~Then give them good care, druid.~
@133 = ~I do not know if I should feel at home here, <CHARNAME>.~
@134 = ~The architecture touches my heart, and yet... I feel observed.~
@135 = ~And rightfully so, Breagar. Harpers guard their secrets jealously. Take a look at the brickwork, if you will, but no more than that.~
@136 = ~I was not going to interfere with harpers, Jaheira. I'm attached to my beard.~
@137 = ~Good gods, <CHARNAME>! Who would have thought that this district homes a treasure like this. This is a forge, if there ever was one!~
@138 = ~A peer of our guild, it seems? Welcome!~
@139 = ~Breagarahguzrmalavel. Dwarkatorbarazbardorarah.~
@140 = ~Bardormar, huh?~
@141 = ~Is Galthur still Master of the Forge?~
@142 = ~When I left the halls he still was.~
@143 = ~May his hammer never break, one rarely meets such a master.~
@144 = ~Consider yourself my guest, Breagar from Clan Bardormar.~
@145 = ~I thank you, Master Cromwell.~
@146 = ~And whom have you brought with you? Oh, I see already, some <PRO_RACE> comes to visit my forge. Customers rarely come here with the heat and all that ... what can I do for you, <PRO_GIRLBOY>?~
@147 = ~Who are you?~
@148 = ~What do you sell?~
@149 = ~Well, for starters you could stop constantly calling me '<PRO_GIRLBOY>'.~
@150 = ~Thank you, nothing. I'm gone.~
@151 = ~I'll never understand how you humans can you wallow with such enthusiasm in your own filth.~
@152 = ~I don't think anyone chose to live in these circumstances, my friend.~
@153 = ~Girl, then why does no one make a difference?~
@154 = ~Because sometimes one is too weak to change anything.~
@155 = ~A typical human excuse.~
@156 = ~(Sighs)~
@157 = ~Oh great! The city's stink is not strong enough for <PRO_LADYLORD> <CHARNAME>, so <PRO_HESHE> had to lead us straight into the sewers.~
@158 = ~Boo says that Breagar should focus less on his senses of smell and more on the evil around us. There is always someone worth a nasty kick in the drains.~
@159 = ~Hopefully someone worth a kick shows up soon. Buzzurk!~
@160 = ~Well, I hope you are happy, <CHARNAME>. Of all the damned places in this world you've finally found it. You found the place I detest most.~
@161 = ~We are not here for pleasure, Breagar. We need to find Lavok!~
@162 = ~Let's move quickly.~
@163 = ~Let's move quickly and find the Lord of this... place.~
@164 = ~But of course you feel at home here, <CHARNAME>, don't you? May the Gods enlighten me and tell me what drove me to combine forces with such a foolish <PRO_RACE>.~
@165 = ~Hey, <CHARNAME>. Do you remember what I just said about finding the place I detest the most?~
@166 = ~I think you have actually topped yourself, buzzurk!~
@167 = ~I thought dwarves would love to be underground.~
@168 = ~In a stone hall, created by diligent hard work and skilled dwarven hands, yes! Not in... in... wherever we are.~
@169 = ~The stench of death is in this room. Lets start moving as soon as possible.~
@170 = ~Not too fast, <CHARNAME>. Quite a few payed with more than a foot for rushing into an unknown room.~
@171 = ~I... I think I'm starting to feeling sick, <CHARNAME>.~
@172 = ~We dwarves are made for stones, solid ground and stable ceilings, not for... for something like this.~
@173 = ~I want to leave here as soon as possible! So, hurry up!~
@174 = ~A cold shiver is running down my back, <CHARNAME>.~
@175 = ~Is death burdening your mind, Breagar? Where is your loose tongue, and your respect for the dead?~
@176 = ~My respect for the dead is unimpaired, drow. Something that your kind will never understand.~
@177 = ~Maybe we dwarves have a different relation to death than you, but we do not honor our dead by laying them into stone boxes.~
@178 = ~Pah! All this fuss about the rotten carcasses should not hinder us. The best part about these death cults are the jewels which the deceased get adorned with!~
@179 = ~I'm beginning to understand why you are no longer part of your clan...~
@180 = ~It's reassuring that the good and watchful gods of this world still have their followers.~
@181 = ~Snort as contemptible as you can, drow. This changes nothing.~
@182 = ~Idiot! Do you want to shout even louder? Do I look so frozen that just a stake could warm me?~
@183 = ~Be assured that it's only because of <CHARNAME>, that I have not taken up a torch myself yet, dark harlot.~
@184 = ~It seems as if we had found the battle ground, <CHARNAME>. By Clangeddin's axe, I do not like it!~
@185 = ~No matter how great the danger may be, we must move forward!~
@186 = ~I wasn't planning on running away, Keldorn. But there is something in the air, a stench of evil.~
@187 = ~Then we will stand side by side against this evil, no matter what it may be.~
@188 = ~Well said, friend.~
@189 = ~Buzzurk. Being here, a chill comes over me, <CHARNAME>. Whatever lurks below, it is no good.~
@190 = ~This is why we are here, Breagar! Boo says that we are approaching our target!~
@191 = ~Boo is really a clever hamster... (sighs)~
@192 = ~What a sight.~
@193 = ~Too bad we probably won't be able to get inside that easily.  Just don't do anything hasty, <CHARNAME>.~
@194 = ~And even though I could think of a dozen places where I would rather be - let us go in, <CHARNAME>. May our search be rewarded with success.~
@195 = ~Hrmph.~
@196 = ~Let's hope that this trip to the tree-huggers is worth it.~
@197 = ~We are here to investigate a disturbance in balance, Breagar. Of course it is worth it.~
@198 = ~Pah. Balance.~
@199 = ~Listen to me, will you? I'm not interested in your babbling of balance! Buzzurk, I would gladly burn every tree in the forest just so I could fire a forge and make a decent piece of jewelry over the ember!~
@200 = ~Leave me be with your nature chatter! I'm here to put my axe into someone's mouth and that's all!~
@201 = ~Believe me when I say the sooner you give up, the better. There will be gooseberries growing on an oak tree before a dwarf starts to appreciate nature.~
@202 = ~I ... I should really strike you dead, <CHARNAME>.~
@203 = ~I should simply kill you. Just for being a foolish <PRO_RACE> who should have understood *long* ago what I told him about ships and boats..~
@204 = ~However, that... that has to wait for I am just appalled beyond measure.~
@205 = ~Minsc and Boo feel your anger, Breagar. But be assured that the power of Minsc has not diminished one bit when it comes to butt kicking!~
@206 = ~Come on, you've been through enough that this little episode isn't going to know you down.~
@207 = ~Pull yourself up, will you, Breagar? There's no use in you folding now!~
@208 = ~Buzzurk. I ended up under shark creatures. Under the leadership of a lunatic who turns into a demonic slayer when <PRO_HESHE> loses control.~
@209 = ~And I have sworn <PRO_HIMHER> loyalty. Oh Marthammor Duin, protector of the wanderers, stand by me...~
@210 = ~By Moradin's hammer.~
@211 = ~I did not think that the pointy-ears could ever create something so beautiful.~
@212 = ~Now you see, Breagar. You can create something daedal without destroying nature for it.~
@213 = ~This town is a true miracle, <CHARNAME>. That rascal Irenicus *must* not destroy it!~
@214 = ~Not a good way to travel, <CHARNAME>. Such bottlenecks are good places for waylayers.~
@215 = ~I think everyone here has travelled enough to know that, Breagar.~
@216 = ~Pah. I'd rather point out the dangers to a foolish <PRO_RACE> one time too many, than not enough.~
@217 = ~So, this is the Firewine Bridge.~
@218 = ~And now you will surely tell us how dwarven work will never decay like this, right?~
@219 = ~And would I be wrong?~
@220 = ~War and treachery have razed the fortress, Breagar. Not idleness and bad architecture.~
@221 = ~Still, they toyed with powers which should never have been unleashed. The old fortress is said to be full of vermin.~
@222 = ~Well, at least that part is true.~
@223 = ~We must be careful, <CHARNAME>. The Firewine elves played with magic here and we do not know what is left of it.~
@224 = ~This stinks, <CHARNAME>, and namely of Gnoll.~
@225 = ~Breagar will not chicken out here, will he?~
@226 = ~Pah, you don't believe that yourself, Minsc!~
@227 = ~Well, let's teach those bastards a few tricks. Sit. Down. Play dead.~
@228 = ~And here we are, <CHARNAME>. At the famous Nashkel mines. A hole in the ground. Pah.~
@229 = ~Even worse, it is a wound from which nature will not recover from in a hundred year!~
@230 = ~Oh elf, you have no idea.~
@231 = ~You should go visit the mines of the clans from the mountains one time, for they lead down miles and miles into the stone and penetrate to depths of which humans only dream about!~
@232 = ~It's going to get tricky now, <CHARNAME>. If these critters have infested this level as well, they will have put down some traps.~
@233 = ~Suddenly this dwarf is afraid of the darkness of a tunnel?~
@234 = ~You haven't the slightest idea of what could be down here waiting for us, Jaheira.~
@235 = ~We need to be cautious if we want to get out of here alive.~
@236 = ~The best thing would be to send the drow in first.~
@237 = ~Have you lost your puny mind? Do I look like a rat sniffing every corner for trip wires?~
@238 = ~No, certainly not. But with a little luck you stumble straight into the snares and we not only get to know where the traps are but also get rid of you.~
@239 = ~You... Your lousy, tiny, bloated, stinking... dwarf! You should be hung upside down over a spider pit in order to drench at least some wits into your hollow skull!~
@240 = ~Now be good and go back to your place, drow, before I put you there.~
@241 = ~(Viconia turns away and mutters a few words in her language - you can guess the meaning.)~
@242 = ~Step lightly now, <CHARNAME>. And if you have a trap finder with you, they should be your scout now.~
@243 = ~Ah, the Arm! Bentley may be a crazy Gnome-wacko, but his beer's worth it. What say you, <CHARNAME>? Shall we have a mug?~
@244 = ~Breagar, don't you think we have better things to do?~
@245 = ~Empty belly, lean legs, Paladin! Even you should have learned that.~
@246 = ~Breagar is absolutely right! Minsc and Boo also vote for a mug!~
@247 = ~What?~
@248 = ~Yes, of course, Boo. Minsc will help you with yours if it is too much.~
@249 = ~...and people wonder about the rumor that ale makes you fat and stupid.~
@250 = ~(sighs)~
@251 = ~Well then, to Cloakwood. Let's hope it's worth it to crawl through this chaos.~
@252 = ~Our journey will be successful if we can prevent the destruction of the forest.~
@253 = ~You behold the delicate balance of a forest! You would have to be a dwarf to see a mess in that.~
@254 = ~Buzzurk! You would have to be an elf to see anything *other* in it.~
@255 = ~A High Mage is said to have settled here. Pah.~
@256 = ~(Breagar spits on the floor.)~
@257 = ~If you ask me, we should take a big detour around that hut.~
@258 = ~You should really learn when to keep your mouth shut dwarf, when it comes to matters that you do not understand. (Which is everything except feast, booze, and work.)~
@259 = ~You are too strict, Breagar. Magic is a useful and powerful ally.~
@260 = ~This axe here is too, but it is not going to hit my face the first moment I was not paying attention! Buzzurk!~
@261 = ~The Iron Throne! Finally! Buzzurk, it's about time! Now hopefully we'll get some answers!~
@262 = ~(giggles) And for their leaders... Garshabazvelkardun?~
@263 = ~To kick your boot into the leaders... Buzzurk. Girl, you're a quick learner.~
@264 = ~I'm a natural talent!~
@265 = ~Orothiar was one of the richest clans in the area until a disaster occured almost a century ago.~ 
@266 = ~Nature reclaimed what is hers! What a glorious day that was!~
@267 = ~Many brave and talented dwarfs died when the mine was flooded. Watch your cheers, woman!~
@268 = ~Many brave and talented dwarfs died when the mine was flooded.~
@269 = ~In their greed they dug too close to the water. No one is to be blamed other than themselves.~
@270 = ~Whatever. The iron deposits are far from being depleted and if our enemies have found a way to extract the Orothiar deposits, they sit on virtually unlimited iron ore.~
@271 = ~And they will never be able to mine it in by honorable means.~
@272 = ~Do you smell it, <CHARNAME>? That is the stench of disease and death.~
@273 = ~What else would one smell so deep underground? (sighs)~
@274 = ~You don't know what you are talking about, elf!~
@275 = ~A dwarf mine has to smell of work and good, honest sweat, but this... smells of slavery and death.~
@276 = ~That's the right place, <CHARNAME>. Somebody is hoarding gold in the area. I can literally feel it.~
@277 = ~You stand in the woods and feel... gold?~
@278 = ~Probably explains a lot about dwarves.~
@279 = ~I'll happily leave the trees for you. They seem to be looking for a nice hug.~
@280 = ~Hrmph... <CHARNAME>, do we *have* to walk this way?~
@281 = ~So close to the Aunfar?~
@282 = ~Ha! You must really just have left the Halls! Listen to that deepling!~
@283 = ~Watch your malicious tongue, Kagain, for your own sake!~
@284 = ~The Aunfar? What is that?~
@285 = ~You're not afraid of water, right?~
@286 = ~Get a grip on yourself, Breagar!~
@287 = ~We will try to advance as fast as possible.~
@288 = ~Durlag's Tower. Buzzurk, I actually get to see it.~
@289 = ~Huh! It gives me a chill!~
@290 = ~Rightfully so, child.~
@291 = ~Durlag's Tower is a legend to us. An evil legend, mind you. The name Durlag has always been used as a warning to never feel too safe.~
@292 = ~I really would like to take a closer look, <CHARNAME>.~
@293 = ~Then let's see if we can find Galthur and Reggik.~
@294 = ~This city's not that big, those dwarves should be easy to find here.~
@295 = ~Do you smell it, <CHARNAME>? The smell of history.~
@296 = ~History that smells of death. I don't like it here.~
@297 = ~It is all right, d-dear. I am here.~
@298 = ~This is no refuge. This is a grave.~
@299 = ~Yes, look around, <CHARNAME>. Admire the magnificent architecture!~
@300 = ~I feel death here. It's so... so cold. Something is here that wants to kill us, <CHARNAME>!~
@301 = ~It is a tomb. Our tomb. We all will die down here.~
@302 = ~Durlag is rightly known as one of the greatest builders in the world. To see his home decayed like this is a shame. This place deserves to be cleansed of all evil.~
@303 = ~Hmmm. You smell that, <CHARNAME>? I bet a gem as big as your fist that halflings live in this area, engaged in what they do best. Cooking and brewing.~
@304 = ~We should pay a visit to the village, it is certainly worthwhile!~
@305 = ~Gullykin, this run-down dullsville. They all prefer to hide their heads in ovens over accepting the challenges of the world.~
@306 = ~You are really easy to be pleased, Breagar.~
@307 = ~The Iron Throne shall be three times cursed for building this damn tower near the damn port.~
@308 = ~You are so unromantic, Breagar. Don't you ever think of all the stories about young lads who were hired as cabin boys, but came back years later swimming in gold and jewels from distant countries?~
@309 = ~No, I do not think of that, foolish brat. And you know why? Because these stories are just a pack of lies. There's no gold to be found on the seas, just storms. And foreign countries are just inhabited by foreign riff-raff that can't even brew a decent beer!~
@310 = ~Let us move on quickly before the smell of fish causes me to lose my breakfast!~
@311 = ~This makes my skin crawl, <CHARNAME>. Something is wrong with the tower, I can feel it.~
@312 = ~I am at your side, friend Breagar.~
@313 = ~Something... evil seems to reside there. I do not know if I want to go inside, <CHARNAME>.~
@314 = ~...Do we really need to go in there? It's much nicer out here.~
@315 = ~Why are we loitering here, staring into space? This is an old, abandoned tower, nothing more!~
@316 = ~The tower reminds me of the house of my second cousin, who at the wedding of his sister Ludmilla hit the table a little too hard with his head and then thought he was a famous magician. Then he built a similar tower...~
@317 = ~Buzzurk! Rarely have I felt so uncomfortable in my skin. Let us move through that scum as quick as possible so I can get rid of this wrong body.~
@318 = ~Don't make such a fuss, Breagar. I couldn't have imagined it, but your drow body is... attractive.~
@319 = ~You radiate a certain... harsh masculinity, which is rarely found among elves or humans. Perhaps I will allow you to share my bed some time.~
@320 = ~You can forget that thought, Viconia! Otherwise I might make you forget it with a few blows from my hammer!~
@321 = ~With that mindset it's no wonder that you could not end up with your sweetheart.~
@322 = ~Stop complaining, dwarf! Do you really believe that your chubby mistress at home could offer you the same pleasures like a skilled and experienced drow female?~
@323 = ~You dare to talk about Audhild? Hold your malicious tongue immediately or I'll remove it! You are not even worthy to think of her!~

@1  = ~Be quiet for ONCE! Ever since we started our journey I've heard nothing but complaints from you!~
@2  = ~Maybe if I land a few blows on your belly with my axe again, I won't have any more reason to complain!~ 
@3  = ~Hrmph! Maybe these rocks will at least manage to keep the beer cool? It's worth a try, <CHARNAME>.~
@4  = ~Well... whoever furnished this likes it big.~ 
@5  = ~Mayhap a dwarf trying to compensate for something.~
@6  = ~Oh, shut up!~
@7  = ~I do not trust this calm, <CHARNAME>. Something is here.~ 
@8  = ~Deception and subterfuge are one's best weapons to enhance your reach of power. Breagar is right... watch your step.~
@9  = ~There... there is a reason why I'm here with you, <CHARNAME>.~ 
@10 = ~Because you follow your master everywhere, like a good dog. That's why.~
@11 = ~No... no, it's more than that.~
@12 = ~I'm not here just for you, <CHARNAME>. The dwarves of the city need Berronar's support.~

@0  = ~Yes please?~ 
@1  = ~Are you Arni One-Eye?~
@2  = ~I'm looking for a silver axe. I was told that you can help us.~ 
@3  = ~You have a choice, gnome. The hard way or the gentle way.~
@4  = ~Uh... yes, I am. And you are?~ 
@5  = ~My name is <CHARNAME> of Candlekeep.~
@6  = ~I'm Foolio Displasius and I'm your worst nightmare!~
@7  = ~My name is not important.~ 
@8  = ~Oh ... uh ... I've got no idea what you're talking about.~
@9  = ~Don't play innocent, Arni! We know that you have that axe!~ 
@10 = ~Listen, my friend. Do you see that dwarf there? He's looking for the axe and he would love to cut you into strips if you don't give it to him.~
@11 = ~Arni, I beg you. This is a matter of life and death.~
@12 = ~Uh ... what are you talking about?~ 
@13 = ~Do not play the innocent, Arni! We know that you have that silver axe!~
@14 = ~Listen, my friend. Do you see that dwarf there? He's looking for the silver axe and he would love to cut you into strips if you don't give it to him.~ 
@15 = ~Arni, I beg you. This is a matter of life and death. Where is the silver axe?~
@16 = ~Hmm .. never heard of it. How can I help you?~
@17 = ~I was told that you are one of the best weapon dealers here.~
@18 = ~Oh no! Help!~ 
@19 = ~Oh, but to me it is. You see, I like to know who I'm dealing with.~
@20 = ~Hey, now! There's no reason to be so rude! I may know something about what you're looking for, but that would be confidential information.~ 
@21 = ~How confidential?~ 
@22 = ~Oh.~
@23 = ~Yes.~ 
@24 = ~I think I understand.~
@25 = ~And... what happens now?~
@26 = ~If you tell us what you have done with the silver axe, we'll let you off the hook, this time.~
@27 = ~Come out with the information or we will cut you down!~
@28 = ~What would this information be worth?~
@29 = ~Hehe, yes, I think that is quite true.~
@30 = ~And if you tell us what you have done with the silver axe, we'll let you off the hook this time.~
@31 = ~Now are you going to tell us what you did with the silver axe or will we cut you down!~
@32 = ~What would the information about the silver axe be worth?~
@33 = ~Weeeell. This is sensitive customer data and if I reveal it to you, my reputation is likely going to suffer significantly... but give me 1000 pieces of gold, and I might risk my reputation.~
@34 = ~Let's just assume you are going to tell us for free. Otherwise, things are going to go really bad for you.~
@35 = ~Agreed.~
@36 = ~I will give you 500 pieces of gold. That will have to suffice.~
@37 = ~I don't have that much money.~
@38 = ~Maybe if you tell us what you know about the silver axe, then we'll let you off the hook this time.~
@39 = ~Hrmph. Well... that is a pretty big weapon you have there, so...~
@40 = ~Alright. I stole the silver axe for a dwarf, who had me take it to the Tower of Anstinus. That's the evidence. Now let me out of here, before people start looking!~
@41 = ~I wish it could be so easy. But this is confidential customer data, my reputation could suffer significantly... if you've got 1000 pieces of gold to give me, then I will share with you what I know.~
@42 = ~It's a pleasure doing business with you.~
@43 = ~And what do we do now?~
@44 = ~I'll come back again later when I get enough gold.~
@45 = ~Oh no, we will not! Hey, gnome!~
@46 = ~A matter of life and death?~
@47 = ~Specifically your life, you miserable thief! Surrender Berronar's Axe or I'll make life for you very uncomfortable!~
@48 = ~Easy there, I don't have...~
@49 = ~You've now reached the limit! Taste the steel, miserable thief!~
@50 = ~What! Help!~
@51 = ~Don't let him escape!~
@52 = ~Don't be hypocritical, we know what you do to get gold!~
@53 = ~Uh... Do we know each other?~
@54 = ~You have something that belongs to me! Give my axe back or I'll make life for you very uncomfortable!~
@55 = ~Arnold? Arnold, is that *you*?~
@56 = ~Jan? Jan Jansen? What are you doing here?~
@57 = ~Me? Why I'm on a quest with these supreme adventurers here, <CHARNAME> and Breagar and...~
@58 = ~These... are friends of yours? They seem pretty rough, if I do say so myself.~
@59 = ~Oh, don't let yourself be fooled by their appearances. They're just a little irritated at the moment, but they're alright.~
@60 = ~A little irritated? Buzzurk! I'm ready to explode!~
@61 = ~You see Arnie, he's just irritated because he's looking for this axe..~
@62 = ~Axe?~
@63 = ~Berronar's Axe, you sleazy...~
@64 = ~Hold on a minute, my friend! Maybe I can help you.~
@65 = ~Ah, so you remember an axe?~
@66 = ~But of course!~
@67 = ~Dammit, come out with it already!~
@68 = ~Take it easy, yeah? I am the one doing *you* a favor, don't forget it!~
@69 = ~This dwarf has already paid for my services and paid well.~

@0  = ~Uh! Intruders in my tower! Leave this place before it becomes your grave! Your graaaaaaaaaaaave!~ 
@1  = ~I'm sorry to have to say this, but we aren't the first ones that entered your tower.~
@2  = ~Your whole tower is full of duergar, did you try to scare them as well?~ 
@3  = ~Aah! A ghost! Die!~
@4  = ~Uh... Am I right in assuming that you are the master of this tower?~ 
@5  = ~No, certainly not.~
@6  = ~(sighs)~
@7  = ~I fear I am as spooky as a ladybug, ain't I?~ 
@8  = ~Why don't you kick the invaders out?~
@9  = ~Your whole tower is full of duergar, why didn't you do anything to stop them?~ 
@10 = ~You are absolutely right. This is your end!~
@11 = ~Ha! If only it was that easy. I'm not that keen of fighting, you know.~
@12 = ~All the screams and the blood, and in the end I'm left with rotting remains for years to come.~ 
@13 = ~Yes, annoying. Why did't you just clean up?~
@14 = ~Maybe you don't want to fight - However, I do!~ 
@15 = ~Hey there! Don't be so hasty, young <PRO_MANWOMAN>. Perhaps my entrance was somewhat misleading, but I really don't want a fight.~
@16 = ~You should have thought about that before!~
@17 = ~Well... Am I right in assuming that you are the master of the tower?~
@18 = ~That's me. Anstitus the Great, at your service. Well, the few services that I can still do.~ 
@19 = ~I've never heard of you. Would you kindly tell me of yourself?~
@20 = ~What are you doing here?~ 
@21 = ~Did you see anything unusual lately?~ 
@22 = ~Haha. As you can see, I'm somewhat physically affected at the moment.~
@23 = ~(sighs) Anstitus the Great, unable to kick out a few gray dwarves from his tower. This is just great.~ 
@24 = ~You've never heard of the great Anstitus? Ah, youth... Just 50 years ago I was the most powerful weaponsmith of the Sword Coast. The self-flying shuriken, the exploding horses' hooves, the ripper of elf ears, the conception circumventer... the weapons were great.~
@25 = ~What happened?~
@26 = ~Watching eternity pass, I'm afraid. As long as my contract is unfulfilled, I must stay here, I guess.~
@27 = ~What kind of contract?~
@28 = ~Unusual? Hard to say. As a ghost, the perspective of the world changes, you see?~
@29 = ~Well, for a few weeks, these duergar and this Reggik wandered around here constantly, set up some traps and dug through my books. This could be called unusual.~
@30 = ~Do you have any idea what the duergar were looking for?~
@31 = ~Tell us about this Reggik.~
@32 = ~So what actually happened to you?~
@33 = ~I accepted a job for a prince, uh, what was his name, uhm, I can't remember. I had to mix a special carron oil, because the prince wanted to see the castle of his enemy burning in green flames. Green is his favorite color, you see?~
@34 = ~Anyway, I must have done something wrong with the mixture and the last thing I remember was a 'boom'.~
@35 = ~Since then, I've been hanging around as a ghost, waiting for the contract to be fulfilled. Reggik, promised that he would help me out. Though come to think of it, he really hasn't done much.~
@36 = ~Reggik? What does he have to do with this?~
@37 = ~What's so special about the contract?~
@38 = ~The contract I concluded with Prince... Come to think of it, I have no idea what his actual name was. The contract though would only be terminated when the Drink Of The Green Flames was completed. I guess I should have been suspicious when he had that Cowled Wizard write the contract.~
@39 = ~The Prince and his descendants fell long ago in battle, but I remain stuck here, until Reggik helps me fulfill my contract.~
@40 = ~What if *I* helped you fulfill your contract?~
@41 = ~Couldn't you be saved just by force?~
@42 = ~Reggik brought one of them here a few days ago, I think he called him Forres. They were down in the basement for some time and I think they must have found something. They didn't say anything, but they magically sealed the basement so no one else can enter.~
@43 = ~Do you have any idea on how to get past the force field?~
@44 = ~Who is this Forres?~
@45 = ~Do you know how to get into the basement?~
@46 = ~It's been a few months since Reggik first came to the tower. At first, I thought he was probably looking for my notes on smithery. So I watched him for awhile and realized he was looking for something very specific. I then made myself known to him because I could tell he was a skilled blacksmith.~
@47 = ~At first he was rather surprised, but we started chatting and I told him of my condition. You know, that as long as my last task isn't fulfilled, I won't be able to rest in peace.~
@48 = ~He then offered to fulfill my contract if I ensure that no one enters the basement.~
@49 = ~Shortly afterwards, he returned with Forres and his gray dwarves.~
@50 = ~So if you guard the basement, how do we get in?~
@51 = ~Well <PRO_LADYLORD>... My contract with Reggik doesn't mention *who* must finish my task. If you would help me, I'll leave you the wardstone you need to enter the basement as payment. Then Reggik and Forres would be the double-crossed ones!~
@52 = ~What should I do?~
@53 = ~Forres is a duergar priest, I think. He came here one night with Reggik. They first made a racket in the basement and then magically sealed the downward stairs.~
@54 = ~Reggik and I have signed a contract: I'll guard the basement and in exchange, he'll complete The Drink Of The Green Flames that will release me.~
@55 = ~A force field blocks the stairs and I am guarding Reggik's wardstone. At least until Reggik fulfills my contract for me~
@56 = ~You would have to compose the Drink Of The Green Flames for me. The recipe and the ingredients are lying around here somewhere. If you succeed, I will hopefully be released and the wardstone would then be yours.~
@57 = ~Agreed. I'll do it.~
@58 = ~But I could also kill you, right?~
@59 = ~Well... yes, I guess the would work. You've probably got the weapons to destroy me in my current form, but I would have to fight back to defend the wardstone and I'm not sure if you would survive that. That thought doesn't please me at all.~
@60 = ~I'll take the risk, defend yourself!~
@61 = ~What should I do for you to free you without violence?~
@62 = ~Oh, really? This... this is wonderful! Oh boy! You guys are great! I... well, I guess I'll just wait here.~
@63 = ~Well, if you insist...~
@64 = ~Do you need much longer? I don't want to sound impatient, but...~
@65 = ~The lab is downstairs. Actually, there is no reason for you to hang around here...~
@66 = ~Ooooouuuh! I am the spirit of Anstinus! Huuuuuuuuugh! And so on, you know the rest.~
@67 = ~Was... was that blast what I thought it was? You didn't succeed. (Sighs) Well if we must settle this the unpleasant way, then we must.~
@68 = ~You're back. Have you... have you succeeded?~
@69 = ~Yes, we have. Here is your potion.~
@70 = ~We have done it but we don't have the potion with us.~
@71 = ~We did it, but we won't give you the potion.~
@72 = ~Be patient, for a little while longer.~
@73 = ~You did it!  Thank you so much! I'm afraid my words are just not enough of a thank you, but I must leave now and deliver this potion. So much to do!~
@74 = ~Then go and get it! Young <PRO_RACE>, what are you waiting for?~
@75 = ~You can't do that! You won't stand between me and my freedom! Raaaaaaah!~
@76 = ~I have been patient for so long... how much longer will this take?~

@32 = ~But we won't sort things out here. Meet me in the cemetery at night and feel free to bring your friends. I will wait for you.~

@64 = ~Oh, do not encourage <PRO_HIMHER>, my dear, a foolish <PRO_RACE> should not turn your entire world upside down.~
@65 = ~Reggik found a common cause with a Duergar. He let Forres stay in the basement of the tower of Anstinus.~

@67 = ~Of course. He was a dirty Duergar and Reggik will pay for becoming involved with this rabble!~
@68 = ~But why are we standing here? I need to talk to your father. He's here in town, isn't he?~
@69 = ~Yes, he is. Come on, I'll bring you to him.~

@10 = ~This is probably a question you must answer for yourself, Breagar.~

@32   = ~This foolish <PRO_RACE> won't change my mind. Find another way or I'll stay here.~
@33   = ~Breagar, be reasonable.~
@34   = ~Breagar, think about Imoen. She needs our help.~
@35   = ~Breagar, think about Irenicus. Do you want him to get away?~
@36   = ~You want ME to be reasonable?! This... this... rogue here wants to drag us onboard a boat, a boat! Over the ocean! But I am the unreasonable one here? Pah!~
@37   = ~Please, Breagar. You know we will need your help.~
@38   = ~Fine, if you want to abandon us...~
@39   = ~That foolish lass! I couldn't care less if... if she...~
@40   = ~Pah, that son of a bitch will show up again soon enough, and then we... we will...~
@41   = ~Forget it, foolish <PRO_RACE>! Even if you beg on your knees, I won't...~
@42   = ~(sighs)~
@43   = ~You dammed <PRO_RACE>! Breagar would never abandon anyone!~
@44   = ~Fine, for all I care. Let's get on a boat. But I tell you one thing. If we drown, I'll kill you!~
@45   = ~Glad you saw reason. It was hard enough finding a suitable capitan.~
@46   = ~This dammed rogue is wasting our time, and now he wants to placate us with this junk? Boy, you're treading on thin ice!~
@47   = ~Dear sir, please be reasonable and listen to me.~
@48   = ~Pah. Worgs. No problem, we will be back in a minute.~
@49   = ~Oh, please hurry!~
@50   = ~Then do your best, boy.~
@51   = ~I don't recall, addressing you.~
@52   = ~What horror is this, <CHARNAME>? He made himself a family of undead?~
@53   = ~Weeell, brother. We are waiting!~
@54   = ~We won't have a stupid little brat tell us where to go!~
@55   = ~I don't remember, talking with you.~
@56   = ~You bet there is a problem! I'll teach you, foolish lass!~
@57   = ~(chuckle)~
@58   = ~Peasants? Buzzurk! I'll show you who is a peasant!~
@59   = ~Go on, attack!~
@60   = ~Not from here? By Abbathor's fat belly, she is a damned drow! Let justice take its course and kill her, <CHARNAME>!~
@61   = ~I don't want to die! Please!~
@62   = ~Don't believe a single word of that dark-skinned harlot, <CHARNAME>! I'm telling you, kill her!~
@63   = ~Don't listen to him, <PRO_RACE>, I beg you!~
@64   = ~(Breagar spits loudly)~
@65   = ~Don't you wallow in self-righteousness, dwarf. You know perfectly well, that your race is not free of blame.~
@66   = ~We will talk about this, <CHARNAME>. And Viconia, I will keep an eye on you.~
@67   = ~And I on you, hargluk.~
@68   = ~Pah, half-ogres! Dealing with such rabble should be child's play for a paladin such as yourself!~
@69   = ~Don't rub it in, master dwarf, I'm begging you.~
@70   = ~I won't move a finger in service of this... this... this creature, <CHARNAME>. If you agree to this, our journey together ends here!~
@71   = ~Well, <CHARNAME>. You really want disloyal companions like that? Can't you see that I'm offering you a good deal?~
@72   = ~<CHARNAME>... I know you're just a foolish <PRO_RACE>, but you don't really trust that woman, do you? Her depravity offends all my senses, Buzzurk!~
@73   = ~An attractive offer, truly. But everything within me tells me not to work for this person. <CHARNAME>, don't agree to it!~
@74   = ~Well then, <CHARNAME>. You have made your choice. May the gods forgive your foolish ways, because Breagar of clan Bardormar won't. Pray that we will never cross paths again.~
@75   = ~(sighs) It's the beard, isn't it? Dead giveaway that I'm not a damned drow.~
@76   = ~The tree huggers are supposed to be behind this? <CHARNAME>, these people are mad, but mostly harmless.~
@77   = ~I will now introduce you to the last thing that shall ever pique your interest. My axe!~
@78   = ~Pah! What is steel supposed to do against my magic?~
@79   = ~Demon spawn in a dwarven keep! By Clangeddin's axe, begone to your hellish planes before I'll kick you back down there!~
@80   = ~You amuse me, mortal. Leave this place, while you still can!~
@81   = ~What horrid deception! Go back to the pit, monster, where you belong!~
@82   = ~You talk big, boy! Let's see if you can do it!~
@83   = ~You will see!~
@84   = ~I knew, I've heard that name before... Buzzurk, so they finally had enough of you at the Sword Coast?~
@85   = ~(Oh my, Mae'Var must be convinced of my powers, if he wants me to work with this...)~
@86   = ~Hrmph. As much as I hate that red bugger... one mage less in the world. There are worse things.~
@87   = ~Let's get this over with as quickly as possible, <CHARNAME>. I can't get away from this guy soon enough.~
@88   = ~The guy smells of stale beer, <CHARNAME>. If you ask me, we should go on.~
@89   = ~Nobody asks you though. (You mannerless baboon)~
@90   = ~What did you just say?!?~
@91   = ~If you want, I gladly repeat it again, loud and clear!~
@92   = ~By Clangeddin's Axe! I think, I'll have to teach you some manners!~
@93   = ~Oh behave and let us finish our business. So, what do you say?~
@94   = ~Well spoken, human. Yet I doubt your mines go deep enough to reach true horror.~
@95   = ~Oh our problems are horror enough for me, if you'll allow me to say so.~
@96   = ~Pah, you almost sound as if we were the problem here. Boy, don't drive away people, who are trying to help.~
@97   = ~One day, not more!~
@98   = ~So... you're the dragon, who was driven off the Storm Horn mountains a couple years ago by those Harpers... Buzzurk.~
@99   = ~Has my reputation preceded me even here? Oh no... let me guess. You are from there, are you not?~
@100  = ~I hate to let this fiend be... but one day he will get his just deserts.~
@101  = ~Oh, of course we will let you walk. On the chopped-off stumps of your legs, you stinking beast!~
@102  = ~Careful, young one! You better change your tone, or I will force these words back down your throat!~
@103  = ~For that threat alone I should have you locked up! I serve the Flaming Fist!~
@104  = ~And I am Breagar of clan Bardormar, boy. A righteous dwarf, by Moradin's hammer!~
@105  = ~Lies, nothing but lies! Surrender to the law!~
@106  = ~May the gods turn your beer stale, <CHARNAME>. What are you dragging me into?~
@107  = ~You are with this person? That means death for you as well!~
@108  = ~Oh, boy. You are making a big mistake.~
@109  = ~Die in the name of the Flaming Fist!~
@110  = ~Buzzurk! Someone made fools out of us, <CHARNAME>... and I bet a barrel of the finest ale, some mage is behind it all.~
@111  = ~You are a foolish <PRO_RACE>, <CHARNAME>. No reasonable dwarf would reject a helping hand in need.~
@112  = ~We have a lot to make up for, <CHARNAME>. But I'm getting fed up with owing debts to people. Let us find this man's child as fast as possible, Buzzurk!~
@113  = ~Unbelievably foolish maybe... What? Don't look at me like that!~
@114  = ~By Berronar's love! Do I have to listen to this whining every day now?~
@115  = ~Don't tell me you don't enjoy the sight! Just like everyone else!~
@116  = ~Sounds like more than just a grain of truth.~
@117  = ~Well, I came to the same conclusion.~
@118  = ~You have sinned against everything that is good and sacred, mage. You allowed Berronar's Axe to be sold, and you stole my friend's soul. Now you will get your just deserts! By Clangeddin's axe!~ 
@119  = ~I know the story of Durlag's tower full well, master Hurgan, but the fate of this dagger is news to me. Not having a piece from your family's treasure, must be eating away at you.~
@120  = ~Well said, young dwarf.~
@121  = ~Hrmph. So the enemy of my enemy becomes my friend, huh? Normally I couldn't care less about a few acorns, but no one should suffer the captivity of this... monster.~
@122  = ~Durlag's tower! The mere name sends shivers down my spine, <CHARNAME>. And not shivers of joy, I'll tell you that much.~
@123  = ~Oh, are you an expert?~
@124  = ~Of course. And then Durlag gilded his beard and fought with an axe of meteorite ore.~
@125  = ~Don't believe everything you hear, <CHARNAME>. Durlag was wealthy, sure. But not like this.~
@126  = ~Excuse me, who is the tour guide again?~
@127  = ~Damned duergar plague! Back into the Underdark, where you belong!~
@128  = ~They are a damned plague! Every single one of them is a stain on this world, that should be wiped away sooner rather than later, Buzzurk! I would gladly jump down a dragon's throat, if it meant I could take a few of these bastards with me!~
@129  = ~Breagar! What is the matter with you?~
@130  = ~This is how any decent dwarf would react in the face of these... these... groscharbulnazdwarmos!~
@131  = ~You... scare me.~
@132  = ~We are looking for answers! Where are the defilers of iron? They will have to answer to us!~
@133  = ~You want my advice? Run and never come back, if you value your life!~
@134  = ~You won't beat anyone ever again, slave driver!~
@135  = ~May Dumathoin lead his soul out of the caves into the light.~
@136  = ~Be quiet, you wretch! You never cared about anything but your own problems, and now you are suddenly worried about Khalid's soul? Hypocrite!~
@137  = ~Huh, so about that reward?~
@138  = ~Erm, I...~
@139  = ~We saved you from a bear, and you just want to disappear like that? Buzzurk! If you don't show some gratitude in three seconds, I will find a priest to resurrect that bear!~
@140  = ~ We saved you from a bear, and this is how you repay us? Buzzurk! If you don't show some gratitude in three seconds, I will find a priest to resurrect that bear!~
@141  = ~Hobgoblins, eh? Should be child's play.~
@142  = ~Well, then don't just stand around! Do something!~
@143  = ~Oh, you think? So come closer and find out how savage this animal really is!~
@144  = ~Calm down, you'll get your turn!~
@145  = ~I'll teach you about respect, gnome. Get ready to face your maker. You're going to die now.~
@146  = ~No! (coughs)~
@147  = ~Let's hope the fool is going to make the most of this chance  the world has no need for another religious lunatic.~
@148  = ~Careful! This <PRO_RACE> is accompanied by Breagar of clan Bardormar!~
@149  = ~Bardormar? Pah! Bunch o' mud-bathin', kobold-fuckin' backwater hicks!~
@150  = ~Buzzurk! Oh you will regret that! Defend yourself!~
@151  = ~Gladly!~
@152  = ~A harsh verdict, but what other choice does that order have? Buzzurk, the enemy within is much more dangerous than those on the outside.~
@153  = ~You got us in some trouble again, <CHARNAME>. Just be careful, we shouldn't mess with a dwarf like that.~
@154  = ~And who is this old codger? There's a bloody deep one with ye? Hah! By the guts of me dead grandfather, we'll have some fun!~
@155  = ~You are really nothing but a foolish <PRO_RACE>, <CHARNAME>. How deep do you want to be pulled into this mess?~
@156  = ~Ye can walk any time ye want if ye don't like how things be goin', deep one!~
@157  = ~And push <CHARNAME> more towards you? Never, dwarkarmos!~
@158  = ~Pray, that it was the last time, if any god would even hear you! Next time you're going down!~
@159  = ~You will regret the day you met me!~
@160  = ~Little... wretched... bastard? Buzzurk! I would have shown mercy, if you had repented! But now Moradin's judgement shall come over you!~
@161  = ~Buzzurk! Looks like we can't grill this chicken after all. Dammit!~
@162  = ~A  gawk!  good idea!~
@163  = ~Wait... we? What by all the devils in the abyss and beyond do you mean by we?~ [acbre_79]
@164  = ~You will make the journey. Are you not happy about this adventure?~
@165  = ~You... you are playing a trick on old Breagar, don't you? You can't actually...~ [acbre_80]
@166  = ~No! You can't be serious!~ [acbre_81]
@167  = ~Of course I'm serious, Breagar.~
@168  = ~What is the matter now?~
@169  = ~Please, get it together, Breagar! You're embarrassing me.~
@170  = ~DID UMBERLEE HERSELF SHIT IN YOUR BRAINS?!~
@171  = ~YOU WANT TO DRAG ME ON A BOAT? BY THE BEARDS OF THE FOREFATHERS! I'D RATHER BUILD MYSELF A HUT IN THE FOREST AND EAT LEAVES FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE, BEFORE I TAKE A SINGLE STEP ON A BOAT!~
@172  = ~Calm down, Breagar. No one's forcing you to come with us.~
@173  = ~Well, if you are not brave enough...~
@174  = ~Breagar, please. We need you.~
@175  = ~Pah! Don't treat me like a hysterical wench, <CHARNAME>!~
@176  = ~Not brave? I should cleave you in two here and now! You're a damned traitor, <CHARNAME>!~
@177  = ~You can talk with that sweet tongue of yours as much as you want, <CHARNAME>. I won't change my mind!~
@178  = ~You blockhead know full well that I am bound by oath to follow you and now you shamelessly abuse that! But you have miscalculated there!~
@179  = ~I'll promise you this, if we get on this boat and it sinks, I'll drown you myself if you survive! Wretched <PRO_RACE>! Fine, let's get this over with!~
@180  = ~If the screaming's finished, can we leave?~
@181  = ~Never! You will die here and now, defiler of iron!~
@182  = ~Oh, we are a little full of ourselves, huh? Tell us your name, woman, so we know what to write on your grave!~
@183  = ~Monster? Come on, <CHARNAME>. A little brawl would be just the thing now.~
@184  = ~Yes! I like that attitude!~
@185  = ~Betrayal! Oh, you will pay for that!~
@186  = ~You will die!~
@187  = ~I am close to a nervous breakdown and even closer to beating up the next person that asks a stupid question!~
@188  = ~Crawl back into your holes, before I act on my words!~
@189  = ~Calm yourself, or you're done for, just like your friends!~
@190  = ~Hey, <PRO_GIRLBOY>. Easy, yes? Don't you faint on me now!~
@191  = ~By... by... Buzzurk. I had no idea the blood of Bhaal could manifest in you like this! By the gods, I'll be glad to never see this... thing ever again!~
@192  = ~Oh no, you won't take your revenge, we will! Brace yourself, you will pay for your evil deeds now!~
@193  = ~You! I will snap your neck, filthy water rat!~
@194  = ~Easy does it! Don't do what one of us might regret later on!~
@195  = ~If you ask me, whatever horror might lurk behind that portal, pales in comparison to the horrors of getting on a boat again!~
@196  = ~I completely agree with you, but I think <CHARNAME> also has an opinion on this.~
@197  = ~We are boarded, in the open sea, in this... this... cockle-shell, and you tell me not to worry? Are you mad?~
@198  = ~Calm now, I think we have everything under control!~
@199  = ~Water...what? What do you mean? What do you bloody mean?~
@200  = ~The ship has sprung a leak! We're sinking!~
@201  = ~Sinking? Buzzurk, I knew it! Oooohhh...~
@202  = ~Why do we need to free these crackpots? Just give me five minutes alone with Irenicus and the job is done!~
@203  = ~You know what I hate, <CHARNAME>? The face you are making right now, day-dreaming of adventure. At the end of the day, it will all end with my axe crushing the skulls of the people who are trying to do you harm.~
@204  = ~(sighs) Fine, let's ask around.~
@205  = ~Careful, boy, or I will show you ug-... ouch!~
@206  = ~Hm? Something the matter?~
@207  = ~Apologies, my lord. My companion suffers from a chronic pain in the right knee.~
@208  = ~Oh, poor guy. Well, where were we?~
@209  = ~(As if size would matter... pah.)~
@210  = ~In other words, we have to do a thief's dirty work.~
@211  = ~Did anyone ever tell you that you have a habit of focusing on the negative?~
@212  = ~Pah, are you sure you didn't forget a little detail? That idiot could fight back!~
@213  = ~And you think, it is of use?~
@214  = ~Hey there!~
@215  = ~What do you want? This is none of your business!~
@216  = ~Oh, but I just made it my business! You'll leave this poor soul alone, or I will make you!~
@217  = ~You have no idea who you're messing with!~
@218  = ~Buzzurk.~
@219  = ~Great. Guess who will be showing off constantly for the next few days... (sighs)~
@220  = ~No dwarf would ever side with the outcast, as long as their heart is beating!~
@221  = ~You won't have to face <CHARNAME> alone but also <PRO_HISHER> friends!~
@222  = ~Silly dwarf, do you really think, that interest me in the least? One death, or two, or six, what does it matter in the end?~
@223  = ~We will put a stop to your misdeeds, monster! You will face judgement, here and now!~
@224  = ~Never!~
@225  = ~Oh my, does no one ever stay dead? This time I'll cut you into tiny pieces!~
@226  = ~Bruahahaha, come and try!~
@227  = ~By Dumathoin's glittering stones! An abhorrent crime like this demands retribution!~
@228  = ~(shivers)~
@229  = ~Not in the mood for chatting, huh? Fine, let's speak a language you will understand!~
@230  = ~Little-fist will die!~
@231  = ~Or yours, magelet!~
@232  = ~You are next!~
@233  = ~I don't think so, mage!~
@234  = ~Oh, I hope so! Go on, give it your best shot!~
@235  = ~You will regret that wish!~
@236  = ~So what.~
@237  = ~Oh, the forest welcomes us? Makes me feel at home. Pah.~
@238  = ~Why so glum, my bearded friend? Unburden your mind and dance with my sisters under the trees!~
@239  = ~Dance...? Under the...? <CHARNAME>, this... this... thing is mad! We should get away from here now!~
@240  = ~(laughs)~
@241  = ~As long as there is a sharp axe in the hands of a dwarf this shall never happen, treehugger!~
@242  = ~Oh yes, it will!~
@243  = ~By Moradin's hammer, don't tell me that damned drow made it here as well?~
@244  = ~Let the bitch burn, <CHARNAME>. (Breagar spits loudly)~
@245  = ~If you ask me, it's bad enough we rescued that drow. But now we are traveling with her? <CHARNAME>, you can't do that to me!~
@246  = ~Oh, I see you can. Damned foolish <PRO_RACE>, do what you want.~
@247  = ~Besides mages who can make whole city districts collapse and the like? Nope.~
@248  = ~Your sarcasm isn't helping.~
@249  = ~Buzzurk! By Berronar's coat tails, such a crime cannot go unpunished! <CHARNAME>, we have to do something!~
@250  = ~(cries) Manlet...~
@251  = ~Hrmph. May Berronar bless your sleep, boy.~
@252  = ~Berronar? Who... who is that?~
@253  = ~She is the goddess of home and safety. If dwarven children can't fall asleep, they listen into the night where Berronar sings her lullaby.~
@254  = ~But I'm a halfling and not a dwarf...~
@255  = ~Oh it doesn't matter, boy. Just listen closely.~
@256  = ~Yes, I will. Thank you, sir dwarf.~
@257  = ~Oh yeah, that's exactly what we need. A pointy-eared spell-slinger with depressions. Great.~
@258  = ~No apology in the world would be good enough, Yoshimo! You dammed goblin scum!~
@259  = ~Well if no one cares to have a chat with you, <CHARNAME>, why don't we exercise our weapon arms a bit. It's not as if we have a choice.~
@260  = ~Pick-pocketing, <CHARNAME>? Do you really think that is the right path for us? Ruining our chances with a god just to help out a thief.~
@261  = ~Well, <CHARNAME>. Sounds like a good opportunity to do something about this vile vermin.~
@262  = ~He must be a true master if he is mentioned with such famous names.~
@263  = ~The law is clear, and yet... Buzzurk. I don't envy you.~
@264  = ~No wonder that divine slime ball doesn't dare to venture down there. So far below the surface there is nothing I would like to come across.~
@265  = ~Even though it can't be helped sometimes.~
@266  = ~Why don't you go and jump into the next ravine?~
@267  = ~Whenever evil raises its head, we have to do something about it, no matter who is concerned. But of course you wouldn't understand that, drow.~
@268  = ~Stupid hargluk, do you have to yell like that? Do I look so frozen that you want to get me on the next pyre?~
@269  = ~Pure... Buzzurk! Do you know, what you are asking for, man? Illithium is...it's...~
@270  = ~Of course I know... man.~
@271  = ~A duergar? Buzzurk! You'd do business with him? That... that is...~
@272  = ~By the gods, not so loud! Yes I do indeed, so what?~
@273  = ~Ha! You speak true, Paladin! Finally someone around here who isn't completely crazy.~
@274  = ~Let's hope, for all our sakes, my friend.~
@275  = ~Why am I not surprised? All this death and destruction in our wake and still there are fools who want to try their luck with us.~
@276  = ~It's not like that! I have no choice!~
@277  = ~*snorts* What kind of dwarf are you to have your weapon stolen from you like that?~
@278  = ~Yeah, yeah. Honor and strength and stuff. I don't care what you say, but a gnoll like that makes one heck of a thud.~
@279  = ~Feldepost a crook? Pah, you exaggerate, bard. But 300 gold is a lot of money, <CHARNAME>.~
@280  = ~Payment gold-in-hand. So what do you say?~
@281  = ~Ho, my friend. If you keep shooting your mouth off like that, I'll have to silence it!~
@282  = ~Calm down, my f...friend. D...don't you see, h...h..how drunken the guy is?~
@283  = ~Pah, if he can't hold his liquor he shouldn't touch it!~
@284  = ~Scram, I said!~
@285  = ~Huh, you must have a fat purse.~
@286  = ~I'll pay whatever your help is worth.~
@287  = ~Pah. 300 gold, a bargain for our services. Better watch what you are doing, wench!~
@288  = ~<CHARNAME>, obviously those aren't thugs. Looks like someone was trying to fool us!~
@289  = ~I pay you good money, so I expect something in return!~
@290  = ~You are a damned bastard, <CHARNAME>! You will leave these people alone!~
@291  = ~Kill him too!~
@292  = ~Oh future generations will be so grateful, I'm sure. What better way to build a legacy than your horrible caterwauling!~
@293  = ~Hmh, you are an ignoramus and always will be!~
@294  = ~You damned defiler of iron talk to us about manners? You will face judgement here and now, die!~
@295  = ~Hold your tongue!~
@296  = ~Life is never boring when traveling with you, <CHARNAME>. But I'll be damned, nothing ever hurt more than this retreat.~
@297  = ~Oh, you're still here...~
@298  = ~You've found those damned bastards and now you don't want them to get their just deserts? You truly are a foolish <PRO_RACE>, <CHARNAME>.~
@299  = ~If that's how you like it, you will die!~
@300  = ~Everything is better than this un-life!~
@301  = ~There will only be one death for you, no one will save you!~
@302  = ~Know this, this will be your final death!~
@303  = ~For starters, how about you stop blabbering like an idiot and see to it that you sell some of your stuff. What a pigsty!~
@304  = ~Breagar, what did I tell you? Shut your mouth in front of customers!~
@305  = ~Breagar, what did I tell you? If customers are here, you shut your damned mouth!~
@306  = ~Betrayal! Face your punishment, damned mage!~
@307  = ~I am your downfall!~
@308  = ~Just so I get that right, you brought an elf girl to investigate a mine?~
@309  = ~We had our reasons. But we can only benefit from you joining the party. Wouldn't we, master dwarf?~
@310  = ~Just so I get that right, you brought an elf to investigate a mine?~
@311  = ~Just so I get that right, you brought a mage to investigate a mine?~
@312  = ~Just so I get that right, you brought a halfling to investigate a mine?~
@313  = ~Come on, boy. Calm down. Then we will see how we can help you, alright?~
@314  = ~*sniff*~
@315  = ~That's right, Minsc! To <CHARNAME>!~
@316  = ~Right! Minsc, Boo and Breagar, united in the fight against evil!~
@317  = ~Hey, what are you doing?~
@318  = ~Ouch!~
@319  = ~Sticky finger, huh?~
@320  = ~Please don't put your axe there!~
@321  = ~Can you picture what happens to people, who steal from a dwarf?~
@322  = ~My lord, the axe! Please!~
@323  = ~Maybe I should teach you a lesson you won't forget, huh boy?~
@324  = ~Oooh nononono! I've learned my lesson! Don't steal from dwarves! I'll give back everything and more, but please take your axe away from there, I'm begging you!~
@325  = ~Hrmph. Fine. But I better not catch you again, boy.~
@326  = ~*Uff.*~
@327  = ~How about we send you to hell so you can pave the way for Sarevok, scum!~
@328  = ~You will go there first!~
@329  = ~Pah. No wonder humans never develop a proper bond with their gold, if they carelessly hand it out to any wannabeard.~
@330  = ~(sigh)~
@331  = ~You are one of those defilers of iron? And you admit it? Oh <CHARNAME>, just leave me alone with him for a few minutes. Please!~
@332  = ~Oh <PRO_LADYLORD>, please don't!~
@333  = ~You can try of course, but don't be too disappointed if it doesn't work!~
@334  = ~Well, <CHARNAME>, I hope you didn't have a convoluted plan, because I think it just failed.~
@335  = ~Slaves in a dwarven mine! Buzzurk, these... berchosloraschgarzim will pay for this outrage!~
@336  = ~Help me and I will help you take your vengeance.~
@337  = ~You can bet on it, friend! These damned slave drivers will regret messing with us!~
@338  = ~Vile beast! Go on, show yourself, so I can wipe that smile from your face!~
@339  = ~Patience, my dear. You'll get your turn.~
@340  = ~I've heard about this sword, <CHARNAME>. Good piece, well forged, fulfills its purpose if you can handle it. But it brought death to quite a few wannabeards, who suddenly believed themselves invincible.~
@341  = ~Oh, please don't say such things!~
@342  = ~Go on, scram you foolish boy. Your mama is waiting.~
@343  = ~Yes, thanks again!~
@344  = ~Pah, and you ask why reasonable dwarves don't trust the sea. Not only is it unpredictable, you'll have to deal with a bunch of mad gods on top of it!~
@345  = ~Please don't talk like that so close to the water!~
@346  = ~You do, huh? Funny how you don't look like someone, who can order me around!~
@347  = ~Our laws apply in the woods and you will follow them.~
@348  = ~Bah! Vile brood, we will wipe you from the face of this world!~
@349  = ~You will suffer, nothing else!~
@350  = ~If I didn't know any better, I'd say you attract weirdos, as light draws moths , <CHARNAME>.~
@351  = ~Weirdos? You must be mistaken! Boo is the most reasonable hamster on this world!~
@352  = ~(sigh) This will be a long journey...~
@353  = ~Onwards! Butt-kicking for goodness!~
@354  = ~Interesting that you ask...~
@355  = ~Ah come on, <CHARNAME>. Don't look at me like that.~
@356  = ~Stop whining and show yourself, blue-skinned scum!~
@357  = ~Dwarf hates us! Dwarf will suffer for it!~
@358  = ~I don't like it, <CHARNAME>. Magic always leads to troubles.~
@359  = ~I hope you think differently, my savior.~
@360  = ~Wise words.~
@361  = ~Helm is wise and just.~
@362  = ~Hah, how about you try stopping us!~
@363  = ~Pah, before we give you a well-deserved beating for that insult, answer me this: How can you tell your girl from that hobgoblin in the dark of night? Sure you never pulled down the wrong trousers?~
@364  = ~Tired of living, huh? Tell your dwarf friend to shut his mouth, or we will do it for him!~
@365  = ~Try me!~
@366  = ~Greedy bandits, your stench pollutes the roads. Draw your swords!~
@367  = ~Here is our money. Can we go now?~
@368  = ~Easy, my friend. You think it is smart to insult the strangers with the big weapons?~
@369  = ~Such threats are beneath me, and only prove my point.~
@370  = ~I cannot express in words how much your decisions disgust me occasionally, <CHARNAME>.~
@371  = ~Silence, mortal! Or the great Tiax will throw you into the pit of eternal damnation!~
@372  = ~Keep that up and the great Tiax will find out who will be throwing whom. Buzzurk!~
@373  = ~Damn vermin. I would love to stay here and kick a few of them down their holes.~
@374  = ~A brave attitude, my friend.~
@375  = ~Vile creature! Get ready to pay for your meal!~
@376  = ~Oh gosh, calm down, dear friend. My my, I think I need to learn to keep my mouth shut around dwarves.~
@377  = ~We will have to do that. Either way.~
@378  = ~You really thought a woman would abandon family so easily? You are weird, foolish <PRO_RACE>.~
@379  = ~If this is how it should be, man! By Clangeddin, may death come quickly to you!~
@380  = ~This Bar'uk sounds delusional. Are you willing, to act on your words?~
@381  = ~Dwarf will see! Should have been silent! To me, minions!~
@382  = ~Pah. Digging up the dead, just to learn about your own history. Pathetic!~
@383  = ~Knowledge doesn't accumulate itself, master dwarf.~
@384  = ~Then get a good stone and a chisel! Record your words like that, so future generations may read them and won't have to rummage through your bones!~
@385  = ~Well, in this particular case your advice comes a little late, doesn't it?~
@386  = ~I knew it. But of course the dwarf is never taken seriously.~
@387  = ~Next time, I will remember your words.~
@388  = ~You made this? Damn, <CHARNAME>. This is a bloody masterpiece, might be the most beautiful thing, I've ever seen outside the clan halls. If you have some understanding of art, you should let this man complete his work.~
@389  = ~Yes, please! Help me! I'm begging you!~
@390  = ~Well, some of us are doing fine being dwarves our entire lives.~
@391  = ~Oh yeah, that sounds great. Hurray.~
@392  = ~By the love of Berronar, something tells me this will be a long journey. Good thing, I'm so patient.~
@393  = ~That's a round-about way of asking for a beating, girl! Better show some respect!~
@394  = ~I don't recall talking to you!~
@395  = ~Then watch and pay attention, you might learn something!~
@396  = ~You have a big mouth, dwarf! You will pay dearly for that!~
@397  = ~If that pointy-ear really knows a way to make some gold, we should hear him out, <CHARNAME>. He's dressed pretty silly, but elves usually are.~
@398  = ~From a dwarf's mouth that almost sounds like a compliment.~
@399  = ~You belong to those defilers of iron? By Clangeddin's axe, you will curse the day you holed up in here!~
@400  = ~Well, go on, mercenary. Try taking me prisoner. We will see who will be left standing!~
@401  = ~I'm warning you! There is still a chance for you to be brought to a court of law! Don't make this worse for yourself!~
@402  = ~Pray to your gods that we never meet again, gnome. Or that day shall be your last.~
@403  = ~At your age I had more important things to do than thinking about ways to run away from home. But I guess you know what you are doing, girl.~
@404  = ~Yes, I certainly do.~
@405  = ~Ten thou... we accept! Don't we, <CHARNAME>?~
@406  = ~Oh the famous dwarven acumen for business.~
@407  = ~You have to ask, slave driver? Come on, defend yourself, so we can pay you back exactly what you deserve!~
@408  = ~You don't know what you are doing!~
@409  = ~We will kick your butt and free the slaves! You have exactly one chance to hand over the key!~
@410  = ~By my grandmother's beard! They can't just... <CHARNAME>! We have to do something!~
@411  = ~Buzzurk! Don't worry, Hendak, you don't have to ask us, we will gladly fight those slavers. Won't we, <CHARNAME>?~
@412  = ~That's the right attitude!~
@413  = ~Damned sneaky bastards using poison! It's a matter of honor. We have to undo this act, <CHARNAME>.~
@414  = ~*Cough*~
@415  = ~Are you mad, you foolish <PRO_RACE>? You will walk back now and help that poor guy!~
@416  = ~Then we will drive them back. Buzzurk! As long as there's an honorable dwarf to face them, these scoundrels won't get away with it.~
@417  = ~If only everyone would think like that...~
@418  = ~You might be right...~
@419  = ~I'm glad you can be reasoned with, now scram...~
@420  = ~Be reasoned with? Pah! I'm afraid you misunderstood me! You move your ass out of the way and release these people now or I will beat some reason into you, foolish slave driver!~
@421  = ~Tough words, big mouth! How about you crawl back under your rock before I make you eat my axe?~
@422  = ~Buzzurk! It's always hard to lose family. You have my sympathies, priest.~
@423  = ~I thank you, Breagar. Now you, speak!~
@424  = ~Trolls! Buzzurk! Now I understand, why so many adventurers refused you before. That's serious business, girl.~
@425  = ~It is, but now you understand why I'm so desperate!~
@426  = ~I can imagine how you feel, Nalia. To lose one's home... Buzzurk.~
@427  = ~I thank you, Breagar.~
@428  = ~Of course, if anything goes wrong usually some mage is behind it all. You should take care of it.~
@429  = ~Our hands are bound, master dwarf.~
@430  = ~Oh yeah,that sounds really trustworthy. Walking the graveyard at night like any lawful citizen, huh? Pah!~
@431  = ~Drastic times call for drastic measures, my friend.~
@432  = ~Yes, me for example!~
@433  = ~Of course, it's not like we have better things to do! Buzzurk, don't fall for such an obvious swindle, <CHARNAME>!~
@434  = ~... the carpets are ruined now, I assume, judging by the boots of this...dwarf.~
@435  = ~Easy there, milady. You should be more polite to me.~
@436  = ~Polite? To you? Oh please, don't be ridiculous.~
@437  = ~Enough staring at me now, Imoen!~
@438  = ~Oh, I..(cough)~
@439  = ~Breagar, I just wanted to say, I'm sorry. About what happened to you.~
@440  = ~I see.~
@441  = ~Is... is that all?~
@442  = ~What else do you want me to say?~
@443  = ~Normally, people are happy when you say nice things to them.~
@444  = ~And you want me to be happy? Because my life might be ruined, but now I have your sympathy?~
@445  = ~Well... yes. A little bit, at least.~
@446  = ~Hurray. Now leave me alone.~
@447  = ~Hrmph. Imoen?~
@448  = ~Why are you skulking around like that?~
@449  = ~Listen, girl. I appreciate your sympathy, I do. It's just hard for me to show that at the moment, do you understand?~
@450  = ~Well, I don't know...~
@451  = ~By Moradins beard, I'm trying to apologize here! Don't make this more awkward than it already is!~
@452  = ~*giggle* But you look so funny! Of course I forgive you, Breagar. Under one condition.~
@453  = ~And that is?~
@454  = ~You talk normally to me again.~
@455  = ~(sigh) I will try.~
@456  = ~Yeah!~
@457  = ~Imoen?~
@458  = ~Erm...~
@459  = ~*Imoen puts on a particularly innocent expression, as Breagar walks over to her*~
@460  = ~How can I help you?~
@461  = ~You could tell me what you are doing.~
@462  = ~Oh.... what am I doing?~
@463  = ~Don't you think I haven't noticed! You've been throwing little pebbles after me for quite a while now!~
@464  = ~Oh.~
@465  = ~So you did notice.~
@466  = ~What the... of course I noticed! You must think I am completely stupid!~
@467  = ~No, but I was wondering if your silver hand can feel things, so I...~
@468  = ~Imoen... just ask me. And... By the love of the gods! Stop pinching me!~
@469  = ~Oh, does it hurt?~
@470  = ~No, to be honest I have no feeling in my arm at all.~
@471  = ~But it looks funny.~
@472  = ~Fine. But you could have said so from the start...~
@473  = ~Hey, girl.~
@474  = ~Breagar?~
@475  = ~What is it?~
@476  = ~You... you don't seem to be afraid.~
@477  = ~I don't have time to be afraid. By Clangeddin's axe, I need to find a way out of here!~
@478  = ~Would you mind if... well, if I could stay a little closer to you?~
@479  = ~Hrmph.~
@480  = ~Please.~
@481  = ~Only if you swear, to keep your fingers to yourself.~
@482  = ~*smiles relieved* I thank you.~
@483  = ~And just to give you something to think about... Gar vos nal ven des?~
@484  = ~Oh wait! Erm... Kas vel nos ber Augmar Dakah.~
@485  = ~I'll be damned, what is it, girl?~
@486  = ~What do you mean?~
@487  = ~I'm asking you. Don't you think I notice that you keep staring at me?~
@488  = ~Oh that. I'm just curious. Dwarves are rare in Candlekeep.~
@489  = ~Really? What about that noisy one?~
@490  = ~Reevor? Oh, he only cares about his recruits and his ale.~
@491  = ~If our kind, takes up a profession, we execute it diligently. And he does just that!~
@492  = ~Yeah, fine. I didn't say anything. Oh my...~
@493  = ~Can I ask you something, Breagar?~
@494  = ~Wouldn't stop you if I said no, wouldn't it?~
@495  = ~There is this rumor about dwarves...~
@496  = ~(sigh) What rumor?~
@497  = ~Well, it's a little embarrassing but...~
@498  = ~Do dwarves hatch from stones?~
@499  = ~What? Buzzurk, who would spread such nonsense?~
@500  = ~That's what they say, here and there, so I thought...~
@501  = ~Doesn't sound like you thought at all! My mother is an honorable decent dwarf. Hatching from stones, pah!~
@502  = ~Please don't get mad, I just...~
@503  = ~Next you'll ask me if we eat coals, huh? Listen, girl. No dwarf every crawled out of a rock. Dwarves reproduce just like humans. You see?~
@504  = ~Hm... not really. How do humans reproduce?~
@505  = ~That is...erm. Maybe someone else should explain that to you.~
@506  = ~Coward.~
@507  = ~You stay out of it!~
@508  = ~What now?~
@509  = ~You talked about dwarven women the other day. I've never seen one. How are they?~
@510  = ~Hrmph. Beautiful beings. Strong and tough. A good dwarven woman can manage a home, her family, a profession, and fight of kobolds, all at the same time ~
@511  = ~And their beard...~
@512  = ~*snorts* What?~
@513  = ~What you mean, what? Buzzurk, what are you laughing at?~
@514  = ~It's just... I thought because... I have never seen a woman with a beard before.~
@515  = ~There is plenty you've never seen before, foolish lass.~
@516  = ~Human women don't grow beards, neither do female elves.~
@517  = ~Pah, and even your foolish men shave their chins. Makes them look like freshly weaned.~
@518  = ~I like clean-shaved men.~
@519  = ~Well, you are not quite right in the head like all humans.~
@520  = ~Why do you keep staring into that mirror, Imoen? Are you afraid of aging too quickly, as your kind does?~
@521  = ~What? Oh no, I was just wondering how I might look with a beard.~
@522  = ~You're making fun of me?~
@523  = ~No, not at all. Did you never wonder how you might look without a beard?~
@524  = ~What for? I don't have my beard for esthetic reasons, girl. It is my pride and honor, a sign that I'm an adult.~
@525  = ~And if a dwarf has no beard?~
@526  = ~A dwarf without beard is than. Erm. It means small, defenseless, weak... a toddler is than, you understand?~
@527  = ~And all that fuss about a beard. You are a strange people, Breagar.~
@528  = ~For a human to say that! Buzzurk!~
@529  = ~Breagar, I...~
@530  = ~Oh, don't be like that. I thought about our last conversation.~
@531  = ~You have?~
@532  = ~Yes, about what you said about dwarves without beards being... fan?~
@533  = ~Than.~
@534  = ~Whatever. So theoretically, what if you are fighting a dragon and just before you can slay it, it spits fire on your face and burns off your beard...~
@535  = ~If dragon fire were to hit me square in the face, I would lose more than just the beard.~
@536  = ~Or... what if a mage casts a fireball on you, and the beard...~
@537  = ~No damned mage would ever get that chance!~
@538  = ~But theoretically...~
@539  = ~Theoretically what?~
@540  = ~Theoretically a dwarf's beard is torn-off during a heroic battle. Or something like that. Wouldn't that dwarf still be a hero?~
@541  = ~A dwarf whose beard is damaged in battle would rather jump axe first down a dragon's throat, than to live on with that shame.~
@542  = ~A beardless dwarf would never make it in society.~
@543  = ~I see.~
@544  = ~And you call us mad, yes?~
@545  = ~Oh marashrazbulnarazazdarzim! These damned boots will be the death of me.~
@546  = ~What is so funny, foolish girl!~
@547  = ~It sounds so great.~
@548  = ~Dwarvish must be a great language for swearing.~
@549  = ~Pah. Dwarvish is the perfect language, the first one ever spoken on the plane, before there were any others.~
@550  = ~Other races might disagree.~
@551  = ~They are wrong then! Buzzurk!~
@552  = ~Could you... I mean... could you teach me?~
@553  = ~Dwarvish? Pah. Never. Your voice is too high and your neck is too small. You would choke on the very first word.~
@554  = ~Oooh come on. Don't be a gelvos.~
@555  = ~I shouldn't be a...bone... head?~
@556  = ~You see? I can do it.~
@557  = ~Pah, foolish child. You pronounced it completely wrong.~
@558  = ~Then teach me, please!~
@559  = ~Pah, I'm telling you it wouldn't do you any good. But if you want to embarrass yourself, fine. First let me...~
@560  = ~... and always remember. Put the predicate first and qualifiers last. Now translate this: "Imoen, hit the orc with the axe in the head!"~
@561  = ~Hm... wait a moment...~
@562  = ~Imoen, ged ork nos nyr?~
@563  = ~Hrmph. Well, almost.~
@564  = ~You see, I can do it!~
@565  = ~<CHARNAME>, I speak dwarvish!~
@566  = ~Don't get cocky, girl. You've just scratched the surface.~
@567  = ~Whatever, let's continue! What next?~
@568  = ~(sigh) Fine. If you want to emphasize a statement...~
@569  = ~Breagar,... erm, bak aurdrukar... erm... auraurn, bak aun?~
@570  = ~What kind of stupid question is that?~
@571  = ~I just tried to ask if you want beer or water at the next tavern.~
@572  = ~Beer naturally.~
@573  = ~Sure, but...~
@574  = ~Then don't ask.~
@575  = ~But I just wanted to show what I've learned.~
@576  = ~Girl, this is one of the most important lessons. Bakahmos gund, gundgelm.~
@577  = ~If you are not... erm...~
@578  = ~If you have nothing to say, shut your mouth.~
@579  = ~Oh. Fine.~
@580  = ~I'm not getting my hopes up though...~
@581  = ~Oh, I see how it is. No time to say hello to the dwarf, huh?~
@582  = ~Breagar! You came too. I didn't even see you!~
@583  = ~Oh don't sulk like that. Let me hug you!~
@584  = ~Hey, let go of me. Yeah, fine! Buzzurk! Let go!~
@585  = ~You haven't changed, huh?~
@586  = ~Why should I change? Foolish girl.~
@587  = ~Ah, so nice traveling with you again.~
@588  = ~Breagar? You really travelled by boat? To save me?~
@589  = ~By the blessings of the mordinsamman! Don't remember me!~
@590  = ~Oh, that is the sweetest thing I've ever heard, I could...~
@591  = ~Stay away! One hug was enough.~
@592  = ~Oh, don't be like that... it's just...~
@593  = ~*Imoen shivers*~
@594  = ~After all that has happened... I'm just happy to be among friends again.~
@595  = ~Hrmph. I'm also glad to have you back in one piece, girl. Truly, I am.~
@596  = ~Hmh?~
@597  = ~You... you know now what I am, don't you? A Bhaalspawn,just like <CHARNAME>.~
@598  = ~Can you promise me something?~
@599  = ~What is it?~
@600  = ~If my heritage should ever take hold of me. If I... turn into a monster or something... You once swore to <CHARNAME>,you would slay <PRO_HIMHER>.~
@601  = ~I did.~
@602  = ~Could you promise me the same thing?~
@603  = ~I... please.~
@604  = ~Fine. I promise.~
@605  = ~*Imoen looks at Breagar with a grateful expression*~
@606  = ~Thank you.~
@607  = ~Your magical powers were enhanced, huh?~
@608  = ~Yes! Great, isn't it?~
@609  = ~Oh, are you still grumpy when it comes to magic? I bet magic has served you well a few times recently.~
@610  = ~Hrmph. Let's just say magic didn't cause as much damage as it usually does recently.~
@611  = ~*chuckles* And I'm telling you there will come a day when you will be grateful for a spell.~
@612  = ~May the gods prevent it.~

@618  = ~You remembered it all, huh?~
@619  = ~Every single word.~
@620  = ~Breagar, you never talk about Audhild.~
@621  = ~What is there to talk about, girl?~
@622  = ~You spent so many years working on your mastepiece and now it's all over. What is there not to talk about?~
@623  = ~What's done is done, Imoen. No one is helped when I tear at my beard in frustration. Certainly not <CHARNAME>.~
@624  = ~Do you really only think about <CHARNAME>?~
@625  = ~Pah. If that were the case I would have to check if I still have all my marbles. No, first and foremost I think about all the people that I still owe a beating. I will give it to each of them in time.~
@626  = ~Well, then we shouldn't wait any longer.~
@627  = ~On some topics it's better to be silent.~
@628  = ~But why? Aren't you happy about it?~
@629  = ~Foolish girl! Of course I am.~
@630  = ~Then show me!~
@631  = ~You want me to jump and scream like a mad gibberling? Forget it.~
@632  = ~Anything in particular, girl?~
@633  = ~Huh? Oh... I....~
@634  = ~Hrmph. Out with it, before your neck bloats out. Or before I go mad from your incessant yapping.~
@635  = ~I... I just wanted to ask you... You come from the mountains, Breagar and I wanted to know if maybe you saw others like me.~
@636  = ~Others like you? Stuttering elf girls worshiping foolish gnome gods?~
@637  = ~I... I meant avariel, Breagar. Winged elves.~
@638  = ~Hrmph. No, we were never bothered by those.~
@639  = ~Why... why are you so mean?~
@640  = ~Pah. Mean? You haven't seen much of this world, have you? Else you wouldn't confuse being candid with being mean.~
@641  = ~I have seen things, Breagar! More than I like! Certainly enough to tell the difference between candor and meanness!~
@642  = ~Pah.~
@643  = ~Oh, you know what? Forget it.~
@644  = ~Hrmph. Aerie?~
@645  = ~What is it? More insults?~
@646  = ~No. Actually I wanted to apologize.~
@647  = ~You... you want what?~
@648  = ~You might have been right. My words could have sounded mean to your ears.~
@649  = ~You are quite a prick, you know that?~
@650  = ~But If you say that you are sorry I will forgive you.~
@651  = ~Maybe... maybe we talk later?~

@667  = ~Oh, fine! Oh my, are we cranky today...~
@668  = ~Nalia, you keep complaining about your family and other noble families.~
@669  = ~Don't I have ample reasons? To see how nobles exploit their subjects...~
@670  = ~You still shouldn't condemn your family the way you do it, girl.~
@671  = ~What do you know about being locked up at home, constantly scrutinized...you...~
@672  = ~I am a direct descendant of Gotrik Bardormar, Nalia. I know full well what it means to be scrutinized all my life.~
@673  = ~Yes but... you don't mind?~
@674  = ~Pah, foolish child. If I do good work, why should I mind being scrutinized?~
@675  = ~You asked me about your kind, Aerie.~
@676  = ~Yes... and you said, that...~
@677  = ~I know what I said. But my home, the Storm Horn Mountains, aren't a suitable place for elves. Certainly not for winged elves. Cold winds, rugged cliffs. Not a nice place outside of the clan halls.~
@678  = ~Is it really so bad?~
@679  = ~Bad enough that your kind wouldn't like it.~
@680  = ~It's just... there are so few of us. Our kind was almost driven to extinction by dragons eons ago.~
@681  = ~Pah, dragons. God-damned scourge.~
@682  = ~You... your people I mean... you also have troubles with them, right?~
@683  = ~Oh you can bet your ar... erm, yes.~
@684  = ~Because dragons love gold as much as dwarves?~
@685  = ~Hrmph. Dwarves don't love gold.~
@686  = ~No?~
@687  = ~No, we just say that to trick it into bed.~
@688  = ~But why... oh.~
@689  = ~You are telling me, you don't know that ancient dwarven joke?~
@690  = ~A... joke?~
@691  = ~Hrmph. You still have much to learn.~

@695  = ~The great Cyric has revealed to me that this *hnnnng* axe is a gift for me! Do you defy the will of the great *gasp* Cyric?~
@696  = ~I won't say it again. The great Tiax will get slapped in the face if he doesn't let go of my axe now!~
@697  = ~Unworthy! Don't oppose a chosen of Cyric or you will regret it! The great Tiax will enjoy watching you suffer once he gets his dues!~
@698  = ~The great Tiax is getting what he is due right here!~
@699  = ~*punch*~ [HIT_03B1]
@700  = ~Aaah! He punched Tiax! He punched the mighty Tiax! Ooooh, damned beast! For this Tiax will... Tiax will... Tiax will retreat and think about an appropriate punishment and you can put that axe down, please.~

@706  = ~Who forgot to get water? Viconia.~
@707  = ~Who kicked the cute puppy? Viconia!~
@708  = ~Who put too much salt in the soup? Viconia, of course! You tire me, Breagar!~
@709  = ~But the soup was too salty. You are a lousy cook. And about that puppy...~
@710  = ~Oh just shut up. Usstan phlith dos.~
@711  = ~Tiax... it is a complete mystery to me why <CHARNAME> decided to drag you along but I won't interfere in <PRO_HISHER> business. But you better return to your place and stop messing with my things or I'll punch you again, by Clangeddin's axe!~
@712  = ~Wretched mortal! Don't you understand the honor that is bestowed on to you? The mighty Tiax is looking for warlords who would lead his crusade against the realms and he is willing to take you into consideration!~
@713  = ~Oh, is that so? I assume I would be under your command then?~
@714  = ~Who else but the mighty Tiax could pull the strings behind such a great undertaking?~
@715  = ~And I assume I would have to become a true faithful of the mighty Cyric?~
@716  = ~Yes, yeees, YES! Can you feel how the mere thought makes your blood boil?~
@717  = ~Oh yes, indeed I can feel it and I want to tell you something else, come closer.~
@718  = ~Oh, what is it? A secret only for the great Tiax to hear, to be kept from his enemies?~

@722  = ~I...I know. But if I can't see them, then... my scars seem to be getting worse.~
@723  = ~Pah, scars. Scars don't make women ugly.~
@724  = ~Then... you think I am pretty?~
@725  = ~Hrmph. No.~
@726  = ~Oh I knew it! Why do you say these things, if you don't mean them? You wretched...~
@727  = ~Dammit, girl! Pull yourself together! Have you ever even seen a dwarf woman?~
@728  = ~A... female dwarf? I don't think so. Why?~
@729  = ~Foolish girl. You are too tall, too skinny, beardless, and those puppy eyes won't work on dwarven men. If you want to know if you are pretty, you'll have to ask someone else.~

@735  = ~Well...~
@736  = ~Pah. At home everyone memorizes the history of the clan. It shows us who we are.~
@737  = ~That sounds familiar. All my life people would try to reduce me to my family name...~
@738  = ~A dwarf is never *reduced* to his name. We bear them proudly, and every name has a meaning.~
@739  = ~Really? What does Breagar mean?~
@740  = ~That *coughs* is hard to translate. You wouldn't understand it.~
@741  = ~Come on, don't just stand there, foolish girl. Let's move on.~
@742  = ~Hey! Move your hands slowly, drow! Keep them where I can see them!~
@743  = ~Of course, Breagar. Behold, the handkerchief of death!~
@744  = ~It was brave of you, when you offered me to travel in the safety of your group, <CHARNAME>. But it seems there is a danger for me within this group as well.~
@745  = ~Oh you think, yes? Aren't you a fast one.~
@746  = ~Don't think I didn't hear you, dwarf. You will pay for everything soon enough.~
@747  = ~Pah! You can't intimidate me, drow. Your flashing eyes may scare off humans or elves, but they don't work on a righteous dwarf!~
@748  = ~I can see through your kind to the core, and by Clangeddin's axe, make one single mistake and I will split your skull open!~
@749  = ~Try it and you will regret it!~
@750  = ~This must be just one big game to you, huh?~
@751  = ~You're always so cranky, Breagar. I have never seen you smile!~
@752  = ~Maybe you should look more closely, girl.~
@753  = ~Well, I'm looking now! Smile!~
@754  = ~Why should I? There is nothing here to amuse me.~
@755  = ~Just for me, yes? Pleeeeeease.~
@756  = ~Hrmph. Fine.~
@757  = ~How about this?~
@758  = ~That is a smile? Breagar, buddy, we'll have to work on that. You look as if you had swallowed a stink bug.~
@759  = ~(sigh)~
@760  = ~Minsc? Can you explain this to me?~
@761  = ~Minsc is not good at explaining things, but if Breagar likes Boo could...~
@762  = ~Oh you will manage. What is this?~
@763  = ~These dark little things in your backpack? They look like raisins. Minsc once was...~
@764  = ~Minsc? Those are not raisins. It's hamster shit.~
@765  = ~Can you explain to me why your hamster is using my backpack as his personal toilet?~
@766  = ~That is a good question. Boo, explain yourself!~
@767  = ~*cheep?*~ [GAM_48]
@768  = ~Boo says, your backpack smelled, as if several hamsters already relieved themselves in there, so he thought...~
@769  = ~You look like you want to get something off your chest, Ajantis.~
@770  = ~Well, it's true actually. A word, Breagar?~
@771  = ~What is it, Paladin?~
@772  = ~Maybe... just between us two?~
@773  = ~Hrmm? Something bothering you?~
@774  = ~It's not about me it's about you.~
@775  = ~Me? I have nothing to hide. Go on, out with it, Ajantis!~
@776  = ~Well... I noticed, that you... erm, drink a lot, Breagar.~
@777  = ~We are travelling around all the time, Ajantis. I need a good drink from time to time.~
@778  = ~Sure, but that's not exactly what I meant.~
@779  = ~You see, alcohol...in moderation, is fine, but...~
@780  = ~What by all the demons of the abyss do you want of me, Ajantis? Do you see my hands shake? Do you hear a single slurred word out of my mouth? You are talking to a dwarf, not to a soft elf or human who goes cross-eyed from the mere smell of malt!~
@781  = ~Erm...~
@782  = ~Save your sermons for someone who needs them, Paladin.~
@783  = ~My *sermons* are for people who fall short in the eyes of the Vigilant One. But you will know this soon enough.~
@784  = ~Hrmph... Wants to lecture a dwarf on drinking beer... humans... Buzzurk!~
@785  = ~What do you want of me, Korgan?~
@786  = ~Oh I'm just curious. Haven't seen a deep dwarf fer quite some time, smith.~
@787  = ~If you don't want a fight, you best choose your next words carefully.~
@788  = ~Eh what gives? Ye're a deep one, ain't ye? Freshly crawled out from under the fold o' yer clan, where you spent all yer days, sittin' around and puttin' yer head in an oven no doubt?~
@789  = ~Buzzurk! You have no idea, what you're taking about! How long ago have you left your clan? Or did they kick you out, Korgan?~
@790  = ~'Twas long ago, enough time to realize what a boring crap life it was. On the surface there be all hells let loose, deep one, ye'll be figurin' that out too eventually.~
@791  = ~Believe me, I already know that.~
@792  = ~A word, Keldorn?~
@793  = ~What bothers you?~
@794  = ~I wonder why a man such as yourself is not with his wife and child. Is it not any man's duty to be with his family?~
@795  = ~You speak true, but I follow the calling of my god.~
@796  = ~That must be a heartless god, if he tests you in that way.~
@797  = ~You think so? Well, Breagar... why are you not at home with your family?~
@798  = ~Pah, I would go back immediately, if not for...~
@799  = ~You see? Our paths are very much alike, my friend.~
@800  = ~What's with that stupid smile, drow?~
@801  = ~I guess I should be glad you are not leaving me out of sight, Breagar. Keeps people from sneaking up and backstabbing me.~
@802  = ~Don't think I would move a single finger to protect you in battle.~
@803  = ~Oh but I do think so. You know full well that this party can only succeed if every member plays their part. So get used to the idea of not only sparing this drow, but defending her in battle.~
@804  = ~You better realize that your little fantasy couldn't be further from the truth. You'll be kept on a short chain until you are ordered to sic our enemies.~
@805  = ~Fine. Just ask me, Jansen.~
@806  = ~Ask? Don't you think, you wanted to ask me something? Are you confusing the two of us?~
@807  = ~I know that look. You are interested in my silver arm and...~
@808  = ~Oh, silver is it? How disappointing. I thought it was made out of mithril like uncle Werner's arm.~
@809  = ~Your uncle had a mithril arm? You really want me to believe that?~
@810  = ~He was quite a capable miller, uncle Werner Jansen. He could grind grain into the best flour in all of Amn. Until one day when the sleeve of his coat caught in a gearwheel, and what shall I say? Ratsh!~
@811  = ~Ratsh?~
@812  = ~Ratsh.~
@813  = ~Anyway, the sleeve was gone, and the arm that was in the sleeve didn't look that great either. Luckily a dwarven smith came along, who wanted to thank my uncle for the delicious bread he had bought from him the day before. When he saw that mess, well, it just so happened that he had a lump of mithril on him. What better way to say thank you for a good piece of bread, than to construct a mithril arm?~
@814  = ~You really want me to believe that?~
@815  = ~Oh that is nothing compared to what he got for the flour he sold that day. The "Red Flour Day" as they called it was...~
@816  = ~He sold that flour?! With his blood and bone?~
@817  = ~You should have tasted the bread they made from it! Divine!~
@818  = ~You are somehow even more insane than most surfacers! Keep your distance!~
@819  = ~These endless woods depress me, <CHARNAME>. Can't we rest at the next inn?~
@820  = ~I agree with Breagar, <CHARNAME>. We could all use a rest.~
@821  = ~And my beer supply is almost gone.~
@822  = ~Far be it from me to criticize you, Breagar. But let me just say that it would benefit the whole party if you would fill your skin with water instead of... alcohol.~
@823  = ~Oh don't get started again. Water? Pah! You know what fishes and frogs do there, right?~
@824  = ~Water keeps your head clear, Breagar. Evil can attack at any moment, and we have to be ready.~
@825  = ~I am ready, paladin!~
@826  = ~Let's hope things will stay that way, by Tyr!~
@827  = ~You have a second?~
@828  = ~Oh I would love to, but this sparrow...~
@829  = ~This sparrow will move his bony bird's ass here or I'll pluck it!~
@830  = ~You won't get away from me this time.~
@831  = ~Oh well, when the vicious dog shows its teeth, the bird better does as it is told. How can I be of service?~
@832  = ~Will you listen this time, without interrupting me?~
@833  = ~This world, as we see it, was crafted perfectly by the worldsmith. A divine masterpiece, and everything has its place.~
@834  = ~And we should be happy about this world slowly falling apart and breaking?~
@835  = ~Entropy is unavoidable, my dear pit bull. You can fight it, you can get all worked up about I, but it won't change a thing.~
@836  = ~But that doesn't mean I have to accept it!~
@837  = ~Who would ever dare to tell you what you have to do.~
@838  = ~Stop placating me! Buzzurk, I just...~
@839  = ~<CHARNAME>? Of course, I can hear you! This sparrow is on its way!~
@840  = ~But <CHARNAME> didn't... hey! Stay here!~
@841  = ~So, now you can't get away.~
@842  = ~Have you caught this bird's tender wings in your jaws again, my dear terrier? Take care not to bite them off!~
@843  = ~Stop calling me that, tiefling! I'm no damned dog!~
@844  = ~You are not, no? Well, how should I address you?~
@845  = ~How about the name, everyone else calls me?~
@846  = ~You don't make it any easier for me, my friend. I've heard so many names for you.~
@847  = ~You have, really?~
@848  = ~Yes, though Breagar is the most common, I often hear "that short one" or "stubborn little bastard". So if you please, I would...~
@849  = ~You won't do anything! Buzzurk! If you need a name, I will pick one myself.~
@850  = ~You want to... fine. Think about it, and if you have thought about a good one, you tell me.~
@851  = ~I will, by the gods!~
@852  = ~I thought about it long enough, Haer'Dalis.~
@853  = ~You have, my nameless friend. How shall I call you?~
@854  = ~I have decided on Eagle.~
@855  = ~And you are... sure?~
@856  = ~Why shouldn't I be, foolish tiefling? Eagles live in the mountains, just like me. Keen eyes, sharp ears, fierce claws, just like me.~
@857  = ~True, well, from now on, you shall be Eagle. An eagle, who loves to fly across the open sky, the sun on his feathers, and...~
@858  = ~Wait, wait, wait! Maybe I spoke too soon. Flying, sun, open skies, that doesn't sound right.~
@859  = ~Oh just take your time, my friend. But maybe I can help you after all, words are my friends, they will come to me when I call for them. What are you thinking about?~
@860  = ~Hrmph. Persevering, down to earth, loyal...~
@861  = ~Like a... erm... terrier?~
@862  = ~Oh, that's exactly it. Buzzurk! Why did you drag that out like that?~
@863  = ~Be assured, I would never make that mistake again.~
@864  = ~What now?~
@865  = ~Humor me, Breagar. How does it feel to be a mere pawn of the gods?~
@866  = ~A pawn? Pah. You have no idea what you are talking about.~
@867  = ~Of course I do. You have received a gift from the gods, under the condition that you would use it on their terms.~
@868  = ~And now they have you on a short leash and you follow each and every command like a dog afraid of being kicked.~
@869  = ~Oh, that's how it is, huh? And that's coming from you? When your kind only exists to please your damned Lolth? Pah.~
@870  = ~You are an idiot, Breagar. I have rejected the Queen of Spiders long ago. But I don't want to overburden you with details. Just stay between me and the enemy. And who knows, maybe one day I'll heal your wounds as a reward for good works.~
@871  = ~Don't act as if it would be your decision whom to heal. Remember your own words, this group will only succeed, if everyone knows their place.~
@872  = ~So why don't you stay behind and throw some rocks... or maybe you could make dinner for a change. I've never seen you use a pan.~
@873  = ~Rotten scum, And you never will! Such tasks are beneath me.~
@874  = ~Well, if you think so...~
@875  = ~Tell me, Branwen, is it true that you couldn't become a priest among your people, because your priests are usually men?~
@876  = ~Not usually, Breagar. Exclusively.~
@877  = ~Hm. Are your men so much more pious than your women?~
@878  = ~*Laughs* No, not at all.~
@879  = ~So why can't women become priests? I don't understand.~
@880  = ~Are your people so different?~
@881  = ~There are professions that are more common for women and those that are almost exclusively male. But mostly, that little difference doesn't matter.~
@882  = ~Your women must be happy. My people have very strong opinions about women who want to take up arms.~
@883  = ~We do too! We expect them to fight well! They are dwarves after all!~
@884  = ~(sigh) I wish, I was a dwarf.~
@885  = ~If I can be of any help...~
@886  = ~What about these cups you Paladins care so much about. Why are they so important?~
@887  = ~The cup symbolizes the bond between the paladin and the order, why you ask?~
@888  = ~I know that. But why a cup? Why not a sword, or armor, or a dagger even? Those are symbols I would understand.~
@889  = ~We are more than just the sword arm of the gods, Breagar. The order is the center of our life, our safety and peace.~
@890  = ~And the cup is a symbol of life, for that which gives birth to life on this world.~
@891  = ~Hrmph. The only thing I could think of that gives birth and looks a little bit like a cup would be a woman's...~
@892  = ~*harrumph*~
@893  = ~Congratulations, Breagar. It takes most novices much longer to figure out that link.~
@894  = ~What? What link?~
@895  = ~Erm... we will explain you another time, Anomen.~
@896  = ~Who was that?~
@897  = ~What? Who was what? Are there scoundrels about? Is it time for more butt-kicking?~
@898  = ~Oh yes, it is indeed! Buzzurk! One of you fools had the nerve to drink from my beer supply! Who was it?~
@899  = ~Ah, that Minsc can explain.~
@900  = ~You? You drank my beer?~
@901  = ~You see, Boo has grown to like you and during our last stop he wondered if his taste for beer would be compatible with yours.~
@902  = ~So he had a little taste.~
@903  = ~Minsc... by the love of the gods and everything you hold dear. TELL ME IT ISN'T TRUE! YOU GAVE YOUR HAMSTER BEER TO DRINK? FROM MY BEER SUPPLY? WHILE I WAS ASLEEP?~
@904  = ~That's exactly what I did. And no need to worry, Boo liked it a lot.~
@905  = ~THE BEERSKIN IS HALF EMPTY, DAMNIT!~
@906  = ~Well, you see, Boo wanted a second opinion, so I...~
@907  = ~Mad! You are all mad! Buzzurk!~
@908  = ~Ajantis? I think you were right.~
@909  = ~I was right? About what, Breagar?~
@910  = ~About it not being a good idea to carry around a supply of beer.~
@911  = ~Breagar! You amaze me.~
@912  = ~Oh, it is quite reasonable, once you think about it.~
@913  = ~And you did think about it?~
@914  = ~Oh yes, I have.~
@915  = ~In a leather skin, beer goes flat very quickly. At our next stop I will fill it with mead.~
@916  = ~Breagar! That wasn't quite what I...~
@917  = ~Oh, whatever. It is probably easier to climb up a waterfall, than to keep a dwarf from drinking.~
@918  = ~What now, girl?~
@919  = ~I think, I found a solution for your problem.~
@920  = ~Oh come on. I just want to help!~
@921  = ~Until just now, I didn't even know that I needed help.~
@922  = ~Fine, listen. An orc, an elf and a gibberling walk into a tavern. The gibberling walks up to the elf and says...~
@923  = ~Why?~
@924  = ~Erm, what?~
@925  = ~Why are an orc, an elf and a gibberling meeting like that? That doesn't make any sense. The orc would crush the gibberling, take his stinking corpse, and beat the elf to death with it.~
@926  = ~Should I laugh about that? Pah!~
@927  = ~That's not funny, just gross. Just imagine, a gibberling in a tavern. Wasting good beer on an orc...~
@928  = ~You know, Breagar... maybe you should try the laughing thing alone somewhere.~
@929  = ~Minsc? We should talk.~
@930  = ~Oh oh! That is the face Dynaheir always makes, when I did something wrong.~
@931  = ~You are doing well, my friend, and I always fight gladly by your side. But maybe you could be a little less hot-headed?~
@932  = ~When evil shows its ugly face, nothing can stop Minsc and Boo!~
@933  = ~Yes, I noticed. So far you have knocked me over eight times, and three times you took a swing at me.~
@934  = ~I did? Well, maybe you shouldn't growl and mutter all the time. It is hard to tell you from a bad guy in battle.~
@935  = ~What? That is... such a... oh, you know what? I'll just keep my distance in a fight from now on. Should be easier than trying to get through to you.~
@936  = ~Something the matter, Ajantis?~
@937  = ~I just wanted to say, that I envy you, Breagar.~
@938  = ~Not only did the gods themselves give you a task, they rewarded you handsomely for it.~
@939  = ~Don't make such a face! Doesn't the idea of being blessed give you any joy?~
@940  = ~I feel honored, Ajantis. And I will do everything in my power, to live up that honor. But do I feel joy?~
@941  = ~My joy was taken from me.~
@942  = ~Patience, Breagar. Once the gods take interest in you, you will always feel their guiding hands.~
@943  = ~That's exactly what I'm afraid of, paladin.~
@944  = ~I'm not like you. I'm not looking for fame and glory on the battlefield, neither for me nor for my gods.~
@945  = ~I didn't ask for any of this and if I had the chance to swap my life with one less glorious but peaceful I would do so in a heart-beat.~
@946  = ~Face your fate calmly, smith. Things will turn out well for you, when all is said and done.~
@947  = ~Let's hope you are right, Ajantis. Yeah, let's hope you are.~
@948  = ~You would make for a fine priest of Clangeddin, Branwen. Our bravery in battle is exemplary.~
@949  = ~Thank you, Breagar. Nothing honors the gods more than a good fight.~
@950  = ~Oh yes, you...~
@951  = ~The sound of bones breaking, moaning and screams of the wounded, crows croaking...~
@952  = ~Erm, I think I'll...~
@953  = ~The smell of fire and blood in the air, seeing your enemies getting trampled in the dust, the joy when you open their bellies and...~
@954  = ~Fine, enough!~
@955  = ~Buzzurk. Better think again, about you as a priestess of Clangeddin...~
@956  = ~You're not one to mince words, are you Branwen? Is there no thought you wouldn't dare to utter?~
@957  = ~Why should I hide my thought? Tempus teaches honesty and candor.~
@958  = ~Candor? That's fine, I guess, but you are... very candid, priestess.~

@21   = ~Is it dangerous in those Mountains?~
@22   = ~Gotrik Bardormar, the founder of clan Bardomar, is my Grand-Grand-Grand-Grandfather. He was the epitome of a dwarf. About four feet high, arms like trunks, radiant brown eyes and a beard of majestic magnitude cambering over his tubby belly.~
@23   = ~They say he was irascible and very straight when he got annoyed, but more often than his shout of rage they heard his roaring laughter.~
@24   = ~Gotrik had learned the baker's craft, like his father did and his father's father before him. My family has been standing at the oven for so long that one cannot say exactly when the first of my forefathers pulled the first loaf of bread out of the fire.~
@25   = ~All of them were talented bakers, but Gotrik surpassed any of them. Clans sent delivery dwarves from miles away only to buy from him. And that's how he came to the nickname "Bardomar". The "Red Soul of the Mountain" they called him, for his face glowed through the embers of the oven and his beard glinted like dark lava.~
@26   = ~Please continue.~
@27   = ~I think that's enough for now.~
@28   = ~Gotrik was thus the best and most famous baker known in all of Faern. At least among dwarves. I know that outside the clan halls most people think that dwarves only live for coal and steel, but that's not true.~
@29   = ~You can't eat coal and you can't drink iron. Every craft has its place and finds its appreciation if it's well done.~
@30   = ~Gotrik loved his oven, he loved the smell of flour and the quiet crunch when a fresh loaf of bread was pulled out of the oven. There was no greater pleasure for him than to breath the scent of fresh baked goods.~
@31   = ~But his peaceful lifetime suddenly ended, for orcs invaded the area where Gotrik's clan had built its fortress, roaming the land and plundering and murdering. The Thain of the clan sealed off the fortress and closed every gate and embrasure, hoping that the orcs would not bother to besiege the fortress.~
@32   = ~Unfortunately it was harvest time and Gotrik feared for the flour that he obtained from the local farmers. No flour means no bread, and no bread means hunger.~
@33   = ~The entire clan of Gotrik's was cut off from the outside world and they ran out of flour. That was when Gotrik made a bold plan: he girded a shortsword and put on a light leather armor to remain agile. Then he climbed to the surface through the chimney of his bakery, in search of at least one single sack of flour. The stories about what he experienced there are numerous and many of them most likely lies, but you are probably not interested.~
@34   = ~All that matters is that Gotrik indeed succeeded in getting hold of a whole sack of flour.~
@35   = ~And that he transported back to the bakery the same way he had left it.~
@36   = ~This too is a story of its own, and shall be told another time. But the story of a fat, bearded man who is crawling through a chimney carrying a heavy sack is widely popular especially with children.~
@37   = ~Well, Gotrik had succeeded in bringing a sack of flour to his clan, but when he entered the halls again there was a horrific scene.~
@38   = ~A horde of Duergar infiltrated the halls while he was on the surface and pillaged the clan, all the dwarves were slain or abducted.~
@39   = ~Since all escape routes were sealed off, Gotrik's clan had built its own mausoleum.~

@41   = ~Anyhow, Grotik managed to escape with a handful surivors. Since they were too few to properly defend the great fortress, and on top of that with the Duergar now knowing of its location, the survivors abandoned the old halls and went into the Stormhorn Mountains where they found a small dale.~
@42   = ~There they located the new clan hall and cultivated the lands like they were used to. Gotrik was crowned Thain and as such founded the clan Bardomar, that until today resides in that place of mountains.~

@61   = ~You would like Dalgar. He'd probably fit into your group of madmen here better than I do.~
@62   = ~Dalgar is almost 20 years older than me, but that's not very much by dwarven standards. We were very close until his departure.~
@63   = ~He travelled? Where?~
@64   = ~The history of my family? I do not think this would be of much interest to you, unless your interest is bread recipes, baking times, and the great yeast drought of '98.~
@65   = ~My ancestors were bakerman, <CHARNAME>, and nothing else. No one ever saw an adventure or went on a journey.~
@66   = ~No one knows for sure.~
@67   = ~He always had been very enterprising and asked himself what the outside world would be like.~
@68   = ~When he was little, a priest of Mathammor passed by on his way and he lit a torch of longing in my brother, if you want to call it that.~
@69   = ~He turned poor Dalgar's head with his preachings that true knowledge may only be found in the outside world and all that.~
@70   = ~And it fell on fertile ground with my brother. He soon started longer trips through the mountains and as soon as he became adolescent he packed his baggage and left the Halls of Bardomar to see the world.~
@71   = ~It was a difficult time, my father no longer understood the world.~
@72   = ~The memories still hurt, <CHARNAME>. It has been almost twenty years and I still miss him like yesterday.~

@74   = ~And what shall I tell you that you do not already know? I am Breagar, son of Baragar from clan Bardomar. I am in my early 50s, in my prime of life. My axe is sharp, my arm is strong and my eye is wary.~

@89   = ~We have always done so, <PRO_RACE>. We have passed stories from generation to generation, long before humans mastered writing.~
@90   = ~But I see, that you don't believe me. So listen and let me convince you.~
@91   = ~Several years ago a young dwarf-woman lived in the halls of Clan Bardormar, more beautiful and charming than words can describe. Her name was Audhild and she was the daughter of the Telormvar. The master smith, you would say.~
@92   = ~A great many dwarves desired her for a wife, as she was not only beautiful, but also smart and strong. Her beard reached down to her navel, her shapely belly arched over her belt and her eyes sparkled like two emeralds.~

@94   = ~Her belly?~
@95   = ~What happened then?~
@96   = ~You better just give me the short version.~

@98   = ~Yes, fine. Go on, please.~
@99   = ~Her father, Galthur, the grand smith of the Clan, had sworn an oath after the death of her mother. Only a true grand smith shall have his daughter's hand. He had only one apprentice, who possessed talent in smithing as if he was blessed by Moradin himself. This is why the whole clan assumed he would one day take Audhild as a wife.~
@100  = ~But Galthur was a busy man, so Audhild took care of the household after her mother's death. One day, when she was running errands for her father, she entered the clan's bakery. There she locked eyes with the baker's journeyman. Even though his face was covered in a thick layer of flour, she noticed how it quickly turned a deep red. She also felt an inner heat, as if Berronar the goddess of love, had just planted the gift of love in her heart. Audhild had come to terms with one day marrying Reggik, but love had nothing to do with it.~
@101  = ~Who was the baker?~
@102  = ~And there you came into play, right? You're the baker boy.~
@103  = ~Be patient, <CHARNAME>. I'm getting to it.~
@104  = ~Hrmph. You really know how to ruin a story, <CHARNAME>. Yes, it's my story and I would like to tell it to you, so you can understand where I'm coming from.~
@105  = ~For weeks, Audhild and the young baker met in secret. Finally the boy mustered enough courage to face his father, the master baker. He told him he wanted to exchange the baker's apron for the smith's anvil. His father exploded into a rage, yelling about how the boy would bring shame not just to him, but his entire clan. "Why don't you just sleep on the anvil, if you love it so much" he yelled, before kicking out his own son. Since then, the two never spoke to each other.~
@106  = ~Isn't being a smith an honorable profession?~
@107  = ~This must be hard to understand for a non-dwarf, but the baker's clan... my clan, goes back to Gotrik Bardormar, the clan's founder. Gotrik was a baker, thus baking is a sacred craft in clan Bardormar.~
@108  = ~I am a direct descendant of our founder, so it would have been my duty to continue the sacred craft.~
@109  = ~Out of love for Audhild I replaced the bakery with the anvil to become a master smith. That is why I travelled to the Sword Coast.~
@110  = ~And now... I'm in the middle of the iron crisis and I managed to destroy the book of smithing.~
@111  = ~Couldn't you just return home?~
@112  = ~You are quite the romantic. Who would have thought.~
@113  = ~But the most important thing is that you're still alive, isn't it?~
@114  = ~So what's next?~
@115  = ~There will always be a place for you in this group.~
@116  = ~Of course I could return. In shame and disgrace, I could sneak through the gates. The dwarf who rejected his father's craft and failed at another one! No, <CHARNAME>. I'd rather be eaten by a dragon, than go through that.~
@117  = ~We should sleep, Breagar. Things might look better tomorrow.~
@118  = ~Hrmph. Apparently you don't know that much about dwarves.~
@119  = ~Pah. Everything is alive. Humans, dwarves, birds, kobolds, stones and some crazy elves even claim trees. No <CHARNAME>. Being alive is not the most important thing, but how you live is.~
@120  = ~I'm not thinking about that. I will stay with you for a while and then... we will see. Maybe there will be other opportunities to put my mark on Faern. If not with the smith's hammer, then maybe with the axe.~
@121  = ~As long as I'm of use to you, right? Come on, you don't think I would expect you to just drag me along through the realms. I will not be a burden.~
@122  = ~As you wish, <CHARNAME>. Sleep well.~
@123  = ~I have to thank you, <CHARNAME>. Since we had that talk, the road has become easier for me.~
@124  = ~I will always have an open ear for you.~
@125  = ~Maybe we still don't know enough about one another.~
@126  = ~You are of no use to me in a cranky mood, Breagar. You have to be in the right mindset.~
@127  = ~Hrmph. Don't get all sentimental, <CHARNAME>. You are still just a foolish <PRO_RACE> and nothing more.~
@128  = ~Hrmph. As if there are things I should know about a foolish <PRO_RACE> like you.~
@129  = ~Pah. I am not cranky, foolish <PRO_RACE>. Thoughtful maybe, but that is not the same.~

@150  = ~Of course it will, <CHARNAME>. But that doesn't mean I have to like it.~
@151  = ~Oh yeah of course! The gods themselves interfere in my life, but *I* worry too much. You're a strange one, <CHARNAME>.~

@153  = ~Breagar, I am a cleric.~

@159  = ~Too be honest, I have my doubts sometimes. Why do you ask?~
@160  = ~Fine, you got me.~
@161  = ~Maybe, but I'm not one of them.~
@162  = ~I've thought about our last talk. There is one question I can't get out of my head.~
@163  = ~Maybe you still want to listen to my problems. There is one question I can't get out of my head since our last talk.~
@164  = ~Maybe you're smarter than you look after all and you can answer me this question.~
@165  = ~What if I had finished forging that ring?~
@166  = ~Then you would be a master smith now, I guess.~
@167  = ~You know that, as much as I do.~
@168  = ~I don't see the problem.~
@169  = ~Because you never would have gotten Berronar's Axe?~
@170  = ~Pah, I know that. That's not what I'm talking about, foolish <PRO_RACE>.~
@171  = ~Sometimes I ask myself if you are truly such a foolish <PRO_RACE> or if you just act like it, Buzzurk!~
@172  = ~Because you are a boneheaded fool, <CHARNAME>. Nothing else. Buzzurk, why am I even talking to you?~
@173  = ~My point exactly, <CHARNAME>.~
@174  = ~If I had forged the ring of elementals, I would be on my way home now, unmaimed. And Berronar's Axe would probably still be in the hands of that giant.~
@175  = ~So I ask myself, was I just picked randomly? A foolish dwarf at the right place, at the right time to be in service of the gods... or was my failure at the anvil predetermined?~
@176  = ~The gods weave their webs around us mortals as they please. You couldn't have done anything but fail.~
@177  = ~You were the right pawn at the right spot. If not you, someone else could have done it.~

@95   = ~But...~
@96   = ~Silence!~
@97   = ~We recognize Breagar as the current wielder of Berronar's Axe. He will not be declared a dwarthan, as would be tradition, since he is on a quest for the goddess. However, all his rights to work the forge of Clan Bardormar are forfeit.~

@99   = ~Please be quiet, Audhild. I have spoken.~
@100  = ~What does that mean, Galthur? What the hell does that mean?~
@101  = ~It means, that you will never be a master smith, Breagar. Not in Clan Bardormar.~
@102  = ~And it means, that you will never see Audhild again.~
@103  = ~I...see.~

@105  = ~Here, *axewielder*. You will surely need this.~
@106  = ~I... thank you.~
@107  = ~Breagar...~
@108  = ~Silence, daughter! Come, let's leave this place. We have wasted enough of the good smith's time already.~

@112  = ~He also collaborated with the duergar. We shall see, what might come of that. But the law is clear in such a case.~
@113  = ~Breagar, I recognize your rights fully. The accident was not your fault and your mastership exam is hereby officially declared to be still ongoing.~
@114  = ~I... buzzurk. I thank you, Galthur.~
@115  = ~Oh Breagar!~
@116  = ~Reggik.~
@117  = ~Hrmph.~
@118  = ~What have you become? I have raised you like a son.~
@119  = ~I won't say any more.~
@120  = ~Fine, then the verdict is clear. Reggik Ragnison, you have knowingly endangered the life of a member of our clan. As punishment, you shall suffer the same pain as Breagar.~
@121  = ~Pah! And will you cut off my hand yourself or will you leave it to one of your lackeys? Or maybe you let <CHARNAME> do that too?~
@122  = ~I am not done yet! Not only did you injure a clan brother, you have allied yourself with the duergar! You have brought shame on yourself and the clan. You will be brought to justice for this. As a sign of your shame, your beard shall be cut off!~
@123  = ~What? NO! Take my hand, but not my beard! I'd rather die!~
@124  = ~Drop your weapon, Reggik!~
@125  = ~You! It's all your fault! I will kill you for it!~
@126  = ~Nobody dies today. Just like nobody's beard will be cut off.~
@127  = ~What are you talking about?~
@128  = ~I am the wielder of Berronar's Axe, master. Reggik's crime was an attempt to spread the faith in the goddess. Is this really something you want to punish?~
@129  = ~Reggik. I did not understand what you were trying to do. But now that I know the context, I cannot see anything objectionable about what you did. I regret killing your friend.~
@130  = ~Reggik. I did not understand what you were trying to do. But now that I know the context, I cannot see anything objectionable about what you did. I am glad, Forres is still alive.~
@131  = ~Breagar... I'd never expected, to hear these words from you.~
@132  = ~And what now?~
@133  = ~Reggik's punishment shall be changed: He shall be banned from the halls of the clan for ten years.~
@134  = ~Let me finish!~
@135  = ~For ten years you shall collect knowledge, that might be of use for the clan. Our halls are cut off from the rest of the world and you know that too well, Reggik. You have shown, that you look further than traditions demand.~
@136  = ~An interesting thought, Breagar.~
@137  = ~More than that. On my journeys, I have met humans, elves and more. We would be well advised to learn at least a few things from them.~
@138  = ~Will you accept this verdict, Reggik?~
@139  = ~Hrmph. Yes, I accept this verdict.~
@140  = ~Breagar... I don't know you like that!~
@141  = ~Not too long ago I wouldn't have known myself like that. But now I see things differently.~
@142  = ~I have to discuss a few things with my daughter. Meet us at the market, before you leave Trademeet.~
@143  = ~I thank you, <CHARNAME>.~
@144  = ~And so the traitor dies. May Moradin show mercy with his soul.~
@145  = ~Breagar... You won.~
@146  = ~Yes, I guess I have. But for what price?~

@7    = ~Do that, young <PRO_MANWOMAN>. Oh... and don't think I wouldn't compensate you. You see, Galthur sent them a sample of his work and... Well, if the Iron Throne would suddenly lose the contract and that sample piece, nobody could blame us, right?~

@32   = ~That is... interesting and awkward.~
@33   = ~Why awkward?~
@34   = ~You see, I came here to sign a contract with the Iron Throne. To be honest, I already did it. Clan Bardormar will supply the Throne with steel and weapons.~
@35   = ~Grothir, we cannot do that! The Iron Throne are criminals!~
@36   = ~If you say that, I believe you... but... the contract is already signed.~
@37   = ~Is there nothing we can do?~
@38   = ~Well... I'm bound by my signature, and you as a member of our clan as well. But... <CHARNAME>...~
@39   = ~Yes, that would work. If you find the contract and bring it to me, the clan would no longer be bound by it.~
@40   = ~I will see what I can do.~
@41   = ~Breaking a contract? Never!~
@42   = ~If it pays, sure.~

@17   = ~Did you go even more insane over the last few days, Jansen, or is it just me? That is disgusting!~
@18   = ~There's no reason to scream like that. It was chilly down in Fred's root cellar, so hearts would keep down there for quite a while. His most interesting piece, by the way, was an ogre heart.

Twelve dwarves stand watch, in iron mail,
to guard the towering gates.

No orc, kobold, dragon, man
has ever seen these halls.
Stalwartly, the sentries stand
to ward off any foe.

Gone to a feast in another lord's keep,
the king and all the clan.
Mere twelve sentries brave of heart
patrol the battlements.

But then the drow, the dire fiends,
emerge from secret paths.
To hunt and flay, enslave and kill,
new victims for the dark.~
@20 = ~And as they see Marhonar Keep,
so vastly grows their greed.
Howling mad, the drow attack
but the sentries hold them off.

And hold, and hold! Not one breaks through
to soil Marhonar's halls.
Axes swinging, armor ringing,
all red of elven blood.

And by dawn's light the king returns
with clan and retinue.
He joins the fight and slays the foes,
drowns them in their blood.

The battle won, the keep secured
king and clan stand proud.
But of those twelve, who bought them time,
Not one stands anymore.~

The other races know dwarves first and foremost to be fearless miners and talented smiths, the latter having gained worldwide fame for their masterfully crafted weapons. The typical Dwarven Smith is strong, tough and insensitive to heat after long hours working the forge. Being true masters of smithing they knows the secrets of any item at first glance. Dwarven Smiths will not hesitate to protect their forge from danger, and while they are familiar with most weapons from the training grounds, in battle they mostly rely on hammers and axes.

Half a year of hard work, has paid off. My research is complete, and I assume Breagar has finished as well. It was so easy to manipulate his drawings of the ancient runes. A single stroke of a pen can turn the rune of control, into a rune of release. When he engraves the ring, the forces in the metal will be released and... I don't really like it, but sacrifices have to be made for the greater good. Breagar wouldn't understand it anyway.

20. Marpenoth 1467

Breagar wants to set out next spring. He decided to travel to the Sword Coast, to obtain a copy of the Book of Smithing in Candlekeep. That is fortunate. Entry into Candlekeep is expensive, and each day Breagar has to spend in order to gain enough money, is a day won for me.

1. Ches 1468

Breagar left yesterday. I will wait for a few day, just in case he comes back, then I too will ask Galthur for Audhild's hand. I am well prepared, knowing that a Book of Smithing is already waiting for me with my old clan.~
@151  = ~Reggik's first journal~
@152  = ~If someone ever reads this journal, I am surely dead. I deserve death according to dwarven law, because I have broken almost all laws of clan Bardormar, and I might have to break a few more in the future. But if this is my fated path, I shall walk it proudly, because it is a good path.

I met Forres, the duergar priest, a few weeks ago. He was stumbling through the mines, starving and mad, and killing him would have been easy. Yet something stayed my hand. I took him to an abandoned shaft and nursed him back to health. The longer I kept him hidden, the greater the danger, that someone could have found us. But likewise my certainty of doing the right thing also grow over time. Forres is a runaway slave, his entire clan has been conquered and subjugated by the drow. He had run through the many-branched tunnels of the Underdark until he came across the mines of clan Bardormar. If it hadn't been me who found him, but another dwarf  he surely would have been killed on the spot.

The more I cared about Forres and talked to him, the more I found my actions to be just. Forres is a duergar and thus an enemy of all Bardormar dwarves and some of his opinions run contrary to the teachings of the Mordinsamman. Yet he is reasonable and smart and I had more interesting in-depth discussions with him than with any pure dwarf.

It took some time until I realized that in my thoughts a great idea had taken root. I needed to end the feud between the gray dwarves and the clans and show Forres and his clan a way back into the fold of the Mordinsamman. No easy task, but I felt that my undertaking would find divine support. First I needed to succeed Galthur, to obtain the position of master smith. As a member of the clan's council, I would have great influence over the other dwarves, maybe enough to make a difference.

But now there is a new obstacle to my plans. Breagar the baker has decided to leave his father's bakery and became Galthur's new apprentice. It didn't take me long to figure out why. He has fallen in love with Audhild and wants to become the clan's Telormavar and because of this utter adolescent foolishness Breagar might ruin everything. I shall wait and see how things will turn out. If he should fail on his own, good. If not...~
@153  = ~Reggik's third journal~
@154  = ~Breagar and <CHARNAME> were seen in Athkatla! When Grothir reported that Breagar had failed his trial, but instead was touched by the gods, I already knew that our plan was on shakier grounds than I had thought. And yet... wouldn't a symbolic weapon like Berronar's Axe be exactly what the duergar need? It would give them something to believe in. Wouldn't it be a divine sign that would lead them back to the Mordinsamman?

I have hired One-Eyes Arnold, a weapon's trader, to fetch the axe. I don't even want to know how he did it, but he managed to acquire it during the chaos in Waukeen's Promenade. Gods willing, the loss of the axe will keep Breagar from Audhild and Galthur once and for all. At the same time it can give new hope for the duergar. I will leave the axe and the journals with Forres, before traveling to Trademeet to meet with Galthur. From there I shall travel to the halls of my old clan.~

Of flawless purity was the silver blade, honed with the finest materials, and in its center the ruby, sparkling and glowing like the evening sun.

And as she took the axe from Moradin's hands, light glistened in the halls of the Mordinsamman, and the sapphire on its tip glowed like a falling star.

But when Abbathor, the dark god of greed, saw the axe, he envied Berronar this weapon. He jumped her and ran away with it. Moradin took his hammer, ran after the thief and caught him.

And as Moradin's hammer came down with the force of a thousand avalanches, Abbathor raised the axe in defense. And behold, it withstood the blow! But the precious gems were broken from their sockets and fell into the realms of the mortals. The ruby, the sapphire and the emerald, who decorated the pommel, flew over mountains and valleys and disappeared in the Underdark, never to be seen again.~

Breagar took on the position of mastersmith, after Galthur had retired, and when a few years later the banished Reggik stood before the clan's gates, he advocated for his reinstatement. Reggik and Breagar never became close friends, but both had learned to look beyond their own points of view and together worked as a perfect team to honor the clan.

I brought the dwarf his book and got a few coins for my troubles. What a cheap skate!~

The strange dwarf, who Breagar called a messenger of Berronar, had a few things to tell me. It seems the dwarven gods are interested in my path.

When the civilized races mastered metals, spearheads were made from iron and steel.

There is no single version of the long sword; the design and length vary from culture to culture and may vary within the same culture depending on the era. Among the most common characteristics of all long swords is their length, which ranges from thirty-five inches to forty-seven inches. In the latter case, the blade is known to take up forty inches of the total length. Most long swords have a double-edged blade and a sharp point at the tip. Despite the tip, the long sword is designed for slashing, not thrusting.

In the simplest of terms, a short sword can be considered a dagger with a blade so long that it can no longer be called a dagger. The term short sword does not exist in sword classifications. However, it has come to be used to describe a double-edged blade about two feet in length. The sword tip is usually pointed, ideal for thrusting.

@81   = ~The long, curved, single-edged blade is characteristic of both the saber and the scimitar, even though their origins lie in different parts of Faerûn. Whereas the saber was intended chiefly for horsemen, mainly due to its versatility, the scimitar has a heavier oriental influence. The "shamshir," as it was originally called, is larger, more highly curved, and tapered to an elongated, sharp point. This makes the weapon slightly slower but more effective and deadly in combat.

@82   = ~The katana is a single-edged, slightly curved sword that ends with a chisel point. The katana is perhaps one of the finest swords ever made, the steps to its creation a long and secret process that is more art form than anything else. This blade is an important facet of Kara-Turan culture. To touch or wield a samurai's katana is to insult the samurai and to incite his wrath. For a gaijin, or foreigner, to own such a blade is a rare occurrence. Either the gaijin is a greatly honored friend of an important minister, or the gaijin has murdered a samurai.

@84   = ~The sword of the ninja, the ninjatō, is of lower quality than other Kara-Turan blades such as the katana. The ninjatō is short with a straight blade, making it ideal for subterfuge. The ninjatō is also more suited to fighting in closed places, sometimes giving the ninja an advantage over the longer blades that the samurai use.

@85   = ~The two-handed sword is a derivative of the long sword. Weaponsmiths have always looked for ways to improve existing weapons. In an effort to improve the long sword, the blade was lengthened. Eventually, the handle had to be extended and two hands became necessary to properly swing the sword. The primary function of two-handed swords is cleaving mounted knights and breaking up pike formations.
